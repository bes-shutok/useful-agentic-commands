# Learn from Communication and Update Documentation Corpus

## Core Concepts
- Communication lesson: a concrete correction, missing detail, or repeated friction point observed during the task.
- Placement scope: the single destination category for a lesson (`BEST_PRACTICES`, module docs, LLM rule, LLM example, or temporary artifact).
- Canonical document: long-lived source of truth under `docs/`.
- Temporary artifact: summary/review/analysis/note/draft/worklog with short-lived value.
- Enforceable LLM rule: a concise do/do-not instruction that prevents repeat mistakes.
- Facts document: a local-only file providing **machine- and environment-specific** values (paths, accounts, domains, repo path keys). **Not** for portable workflow policy, numeric thresholds, or skill behavior; those belong in the owning skill's `SKILL.md`. This skill reads facts keys for path resolution, see `user_facts_path` and repo `repo_facts_rel`.

## When to Use
Use this skill when asked to:
- learn from communication in the current task,
- capture recurring mistakes/corrections,
- update repository docs or instruction rules from lessons learned,
- consolidate duplicated documentation.

Keep this skill scoped to documentation/instruction corpus updates. Do not use it to trigger product code or contract refactors. Do not commit changes; committing is the `done` skill's responsibility.

**Writing project lessons corpus:** Before each Write/Edit to the repo's project lessons file (`docs/maintenance/development_lessons.md`), refresh the skill-gate learn marker per `ai-playbook/agents/hooks/skill-gate/README.md` (learn class WRITE RECIPE: derive `project` and `session` per Terms, invoke the shared `session_channel.py` subprocess VERBATIM, then `python3 ~/.ai-playbook/scripts/skill_gate.py --write-marker learn --session-id "$SID"`). Run this on EVERY project-corpus write (create AND update). FAIL-LOUD if the marker write fails. Do NOT inline path/body/window constants here; the README is the single source (Family D).

## Goal
In one run:
1. Extract lessons from communication in the current task context.
2. Reset the learn counter by deleting `/tmp/learn-counter-${PPID}-<dir_hash>` where `<dir_hash>` is the first 12 hex chars of `shasum` of `$PWD` (the session+project-scoped counter that reminds you to run learn before compaction).
3. Place each lesson at the correct scope.
3. Consolidate docs to remove duplication.
4. Update instruction files only with enforceable, high-value rules.
5. Consolidate instruction rules by grouping overlaps and removing ambiguous/redundant duplicates.
6. Keep repository structure and module layout compliant.
7. Keep this workflow scoped to documentation/instruction corpus updates only.

### Repeated failures and mechanical invariants

When the same class of failure appears more than once, do not only restate prompt advice. Ask which harness component is missing (instruction, source of truth, tool, validator, permission rule, eval, or recovery path), then encode the fix at the right scope. Prefer mechanical checks (lint rules, schema validators, hooks, regression evals) when the rule is enforceable without judgment. For the general harness pattern, see `agents-best-practices/references/agent-legibility-feedback-loops.md`.

## Step 1: Extract Lessons
Review communication from this task and list concrete items:
- mistakes and false assumptions
- user corrections and constraints
- missing or misleading documentation
- recurring rework/friction

Classify each lesson as exactly one:
- Human best-practice guidance
- Module/system-specific knowledge
- Enforceable LLM instruction rule
- LLM-only example/playbook
- Temporary artifact

**Important: style and wording corrections are lessons too.** If a user corrects the tone, phrasing, vocabulary, or formatting of generated output (e.g. "remove long dashes", "use simpler words", "prefer globish", "use API contract not wire contract"), treat it as a lesson and capture it as a skill rule, not just apply it to the current artifact and move on. Vocabulary replacements that apply across projects go in `agent_workflow_guidelines.md` §45.2; recurring workspace terms go in the relevant `dictionary.md` or repo glossary (`docs/maintenance/glossary.md` after migration; legacy `docs/glossary.md`).

### Correction ledger for overturned technical output
When a user corrects, rejects, or materially redirects a technical explanation or implementation, build a correction ledger before classifying the lesson. Record: the initial claim or recommendation, the rejected alternative, the user-supplied correction, the evidence that settled the dispute (source, log, reproduction, or test), the corrected mechanism, and the missing verification step. Review the complete current-task conversation, including failed attempts and user-provided attachments, rather than deriving lessons only from the final diff or a completion summary. Preserve both layers when they differ: the technical mechanism belongs in the appropriate canonical project or language guidance, and the missing verification step belongs in the owning workflow skill when it could prevent the same correction in a future task.

### Source-check self-audit
When the user corrects a factual detail or asks what could have been learned by digging deeper, explicitly ask:
- Could an available source system, repository artifact, ticket comment, PR state, log, or local file have revealed this before the user corrected it?
- Did I stop at a summary when primary sources were available?
- Is the lesson only the corrected fact, or is the deeper lesson a missing verification step?

When a user challenges a framework explanation, also check whether the verified behavior is a
reusable language or framework guideline. Do not classify it as conversational clarification
until the applicable canonical guideline file has been checked for an existing rule or a missing
durable rule.

For framework or integration behavior, verify the exact boundary that failed: exercise the
actual adapter, mapper, serializer, or client with the proposed method signature and inspect
both execution and result mapping. A successful side effect is not proof that the surrounding
return-type contract is valid. If the proposed and corrected forms differ, test the rejected
form or preserve its observed failure as the witness before dismissing it as already covered.

If the answer is yes, capture the deeper verification rule, not only the corrected output. For example, if a weekly report missed replaced PRs, Jira-comment-only work, or ownership split across two Jira stories, the lesson is to check GitHub/Jira source state before drafting ambiguous report sections.

### Generalization pass
Before writing any lesson to its final destination, apply a generalization pass:

1. **Identify the abstract principle** behind the specific incident. Ask: "What is the underlying pattern, independent of this particular technology, file, module, **or employer identity**?" Generalize across all of these axes, not only technology: a rule that still requires a specific company, service name, or ticket system to be stated has not been fully generalized.
1b. **Name the root-cause family and the shape trigger.** Identify which family in the principle catalog (`coding_guidelines.md` #17+) this incident belongs to, and write the *shape trigger*: the situation (independent of this file/module) that should make a future reader suspect this family. If no family fits, propose one to the catalog rather than leaving the lesson unanchored. See the `generalize` skill (`../generalize/SKILL.md`) for the map procedure.
1c. **Interrogate every proper noun and identifier in the incident** before drafting. Service names, company names, product names, ticket prefixes/IDs, branch/plan slugs, person names, customer/market lists, internal hostnames/URLs, and exact counts/dates are NOT background color: each one must earn its place. For each, ask: "Would the rule be weaker if I replaced this with a generic role ('the target service', 'a reviewer', 'the new markets', 'the feature branch')?" If no, the generic form IS the lesson; the specific value belongs only in your private notes, never in a corpus that may be public. This step is what stops an example from being drafted around `<employer>-<product>-service` / a country-code list / `<TICKET>-10889` in the first place: those read as incidental context but are employer fingerprints.
2. **State the general rule first**, then add the specific instance as a concrete example. The rule should remain correct even if the specific tool, framework, or module changes.
2b. **Format using the standard Principle-based Template**: When adding a new lesson (e.g., to `development_lessons.md`), format it according to the standard template defined in the `generalize` skill (`../generalize/SKILL.md` Phase 4.5).
3. **Check whether the generalized rule already exists** in canonical docs or instruction files, and whether an existing same-family lesson already covers this shape. If either holds, add only the missing witness and cross-link rather than creating a near-duplicate; do not create a duplicate rule.
3b. **Incident-repo vs cwd pre-check (required before the four-way fork in item 4).** Before classifying as fork (3) cross-project UL, identify the repo where the incident occurred  -  the witness's repo, derived from file paths, git history, or session context (NOT the cwd where `learn` happens to be running). If that repo is **not** the current cwd repo, you are capturing a **deferred lesson**: STOP and either (a) `cd` to the incident repo and re-run `learn` there so it lands in that repo's `docs/maintenance/development_lessons.md`, or (b) ask the user whether to defer the capture. **Never write a project-specific incident into the UL corpus just because that is the corpus available in the current cwd**  -  this is exactly how the playbook UL corpus came to hold project-specific lessons: the playbook repo has no project corpus of its own, so any incident captured while cwd is the playbook repo defaulted into the only corpus on disk (the UL file). Item 4's four-way fork is judgment; this pre-check is the high-recall first gate that catches the cross-repo case before judgment is applied.
4. **Decide the scope**: after generalizing, apply the FIRST discriminator - **abstract precept vs concrete lesson** - then assess portability. Do **not** treat "not useful in every language" as proof the rule is project-specific. Four-way fork (resolve `shared_docs_dir` from `user_facts_path`):
   - **(1) Abstract universal precept -> `coding_guidelines.md`**: a do/do-not rule that is correct and useful in *any* project (Kotlin microservice, Python data pipeline, frontend app) and carries no incident witness. If the rule mentions FIFO matching, batch aggregation, CSV parsing, report generation, or similar domain concepts, it is likely too specific for this file even after generalization.
   - **(2) Stack or language-ecosystem precept -> language/JVM file under `shared_docs_dir`**: a do/do-not (or short methodology) rule that is portable across repos of one stack or language but not every language. Examples: Java/Kotlin import vs fully qualified type names, MockK/Mockito idioms, Reactor error stubbing, Python packaging patterns. Place the **full rule** in the matching file (`jvm_guidelines.md` for shared JVM/Java+Kotlin style, `java_guidelines.md` / `kotlin_guidelines.md` / `python_guidelines.md` for language-only). Add a one-line pointer in user `AGENTS.md` shared-guidelines index when a new `#N` is easy to miss. In the incident repo, keep **at most** a thin project-corpus witness pointer (`see jvm_guidelines.md #N`), never the full rule body. **Default here when the rule would correctly guide an unrelated service in the same language/stack with no shared domain model.**
   - **(3) Concrete cross-project lesson -> user-level corpus**: a generalized lesson whose value is the **incident witness** (mechanism + failure mode) and that would re-bite in another project of any stack. Tag it strict (`**Principle:** Family X`, next `UL#N`) in the user-level `development_lessons.md` (resolved from `shared_docs_dir`); Step 6.6 gates this corpus. Prefer (3) over flattening into (1)/(2) when stripping the witness loses the preventive signal.
   - **(4) Project-specific -> repo `development_lessons.md`**: a reusable principle within this project that **requires** domain context (financial calculations, data matching, tax reporting, product-specific contracts). Write it as a general principle with repo-specific examples, convention-tagged (`**Principle:** Family X`). Module-level quirks stay module-scoped but still phrased as a reusable principle for that module rather than a one-off incident report.
4b. **Stack-portability gate (required before fork (4) full project lesson).** Ask: "Would this rule correctly guide work in an unrelated repo that shares only the language or JVM/Spring/Python stack, with no shared domain?" If **yes**, you are in fork **(2)** (or (1) if truly universal): write the canonical rule under `shared_docs_dir` first, then optionally a witness pointer in the project corpus. If you almost chose fork (4) because the incident happened in one product repo, re-run this gate. Anti-pattern: dumping Java/Kotlin style hygiene into `development_lessons.md` as a full `#N` because it "is not Python-universal" (that is fork (2), not fork (4)).
5. **Place accordingly**: write the full text at the chosen scope. If the rule goes to shared canonical docs (fork 1 or 2), reduce the project instruction / project corpus entry to a cross-reference (plus optional short witness). If it stays project-level (fork 4), write the full lesson in the project corpus.
5b. **Mirror-fan-out when this skill's fork changes:** if you renumber or retarget the placement fork (item 4 / 4b), grep sibling skills for `mirrors learn`, `three-way fork`, and `fork 2 vs fork 3`, and update every living claim that mirrors this pass (especially `generalize`) in the **same change set**. Also update living UL See also lines that cite item 4 by those old labels. Do not leave a skill claiming it mirrors learn while still describing the previous fork.
6. **Add cross-references for discoverability**: When placing or updating a lesson in project docs (development_lessons.md), also add or update cross-references from instruction files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md) so the lesson is discoverable when working on the relevant topic. A guideline in `development_lessons.md` is only useful if agents know to look for it when processing related code. Check for sibling documents (grep for related keywords) that should reference the same lesson.
7. **Verify numbered lesson anchors before writing**: when a lesson cites another lesson by number (Principle, See also, Distinguishing), grep the target corpus for the cited `## N.` heading FIRST and confirm that heading's topic matches the cited description; a number that resolves to an unrelated lesson silently breaks the recall chain. Never copy a cited number from memory or from another lesson's text.

Example:
- **Too specific**: "Excel column headers in the crypto gains sheet should say 'Quantity' instead of 'Amount'"
- **Generalized (fork 1, universal)**: "User-facing output labels (column headers, API field names, report section titles) should use self-explanatory terminology, not terse names inherited from upstream source formats." → any project, any output surface → `coding_guidelines.md`.
- **Generalized (fork 2, stack/language)**: "Prefer imports over fully qualified type names for annotations and constructors; when one FQN is fixed in review, fan out across PR-touched sources." → true for any Java/Kotlin repo, useless as a Python rule → full text in `jvm_guidelines.md` (pointers from `java_guidelines.md` / `kotlin_guidelines.md`); project corpus gets at most a witness pointer. **Wrong default:** a full project `development_lessons.md` `#N` because the incident was reviewed on one service PR.
- **Generalized but project-scoped (fork 4)**: "Post-aggregation validation must run after all groups are accumulated, not per-row." → sounds general but assumes batch row processing with mid-accumulation state, so only relevant in data-pipeline projects → keep full text in project corpus, do not elevate to `coding_guidelines.md` or `jvm_guidelines.md`.
- **Identity generalization (required on every lesson)**: Draft example *"On `<config-repo>` PR #6, commits added `<country-list>` markets but the title still said `<TICKET>-10889: Add <service>-<market> UAT config draft`"* → the employer fingerprints are the config-repo name, the country list, the ticket prefix+ID, and the service slug. None are load-bearing for the rule "keep the PR title in sync with scope as it expands." Generalize to: *"On a config PR, commits added new markets and segment keys but the title still named only the original market draft"* (rule identical, no employer identity leaked). The discriminator: if replacing the identifier with a role/category leaves the rule intact, the identifier was fingerprint, not lesson.

### Anti-pattern: premature dismissal as "already covered"
Before discarding a candidate lesson because an existing rule seems to cover it,
verify that the **specific failure mode** from this session is addressed, not
just the general topic. Common missed distinctions:
- **Policy vs methodology**: an existing rule says *what* to do (e.g. "don't
  commit formatting-only files") but the lesson is about *how* to do it reliably
  (e.g. "`git diff -w` misses trailing commas"). Both need separate rules.
- **Narrow vs broad**: the specific instance was captured (e.g. "link RFC
  references to Confluence") but the general principle was not (e.g. "protect
  any non-obvious design choice with an inline rationale comment").
- **Symptom vs root cause**: a correction was made (e.g. "restore Dispatchers.IO")
  but the preventive measure was not captured (e.g. "add inline comments to
  prevent future removal of intentional design choices").

When in doubt, write the candidate lesson and run it through Step 3's
qualification gate rather than skipping it at extraction time.

## Step 1.5: Ralphex Execution Log Analysis (when available)

When `.ralphex/progress/` exists in the current project directory:

1. Read the 5 most recent `*.txt` files from `.ralphex/progress/` (by modification time).
2. For each log, extract recurring patterns:
   - **Rate-limit hits**: phase where the limit was hit (task/review/automation), frequency, reset window noted in the log.
   - **Review-phase warnings**: `first review pass did not complete cleanly` (non-fatal; flag if frequent).
   - **Already-done detection**: agent found work pre-completed in a prior commit; note if it caused repeated plan runs.
   - **Environment/tool gaps**: tool not found inside container (Maven, Python, etc.) during a phase that assumed it was available.
   - **Automated review loop failures**: external review parse or exit errors.
3. Classify each extracted pattern using the same Step 1 categories (human guidance, module knowledge, LLM rule, or temporary).
4. Feed classified patterns into the placement workflow (Steps 2–6) alongside lessons from communication.

**Specific placement guidance for common patterns:**
- Frequent rate-limit hits → resolved best-practices path (`docs/maintenance/best-practices.md` after migration; legacy `docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md` only when exploration confirms it still exists) or cross-project shared docs (from facts `shared_docs_dir`): plan size guidelines, recommended run windows.
- Container tool gaps → project `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`: document which tools are available in which execution phase.
- Automated review loop failures → note disabling the external review loop in project or user-level docs when applicable.
- Non-fatal review warnings → no action needed unless they occur in every run; if so, note as known pattern in project docs.

## Step 1.6: Internet Research Capture

When research is conducted via web search or other external sources:

**Always capture findings to dedicated documentation:**
- Create or update canonical docs in `docs/` with numbered chapters/clauses
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `pdf_generation_guidelines.md`, not `research.md`)
- Include comparison tables, code examples, and source links
- Reference these docs from instruction files (e.g., `see pdf_generation_guidelines.md #1`)

**Format for research docs:**
- Start with Purpose section explaining what the doc covers
- Use numbered chapters (## 1, ## 2) and clauses (### 1.1, ### 1.2)
- Include "Quick Reference" or comparison tables when applicable
- Add Sources section at the end with URLs and dates

**LLM examples vs canonical docs:**
- Canonical docs = technical facts, best practices, comparisons (home per `.ai-playbook/facts.md` TOML and project guidelines)
- LLM examples / playbooks = reasoning patterns, anti-patterns (resolve `caller_catalog`, `{tmp_dir}`, or project-documented example path; do not assume `docs/examples/`)
- Examples file should reference main doc, not duplicate it

**When to create new research docs:**
- After web search for best practices, technical comparisons, tool selection
- When user asks for research on a topic
- When the same questions recur across sessions
- Before making technical decisions with alternatives

## Step 1.7: Proper-Noun Justification Review (required before any lesson is written)

This gate is the second layer of defense after the Step 1.2 generalization pass (item 1c). Where 1.2 prevents identifiers from entering the draft, this gate catches any that slipped through by re-reading the *already drafted* text and forcing a justification per identifier. It is NOT a checklist of known-bad tokens  -  such lists cannot catch the next employer's service names, ticket prefixes, or the bare company name (the leaks that motivated this gate all bypassed enumeration-based scans). It is a per-identifier judgment review.

**Why this matters:** Lessons land in corpora that may be public (this playbook is a public repo; project corpora can be synced, forked, or pasted into tickets/PRs). A lesson's value is the generalized rule; employer fingerprints add zero rule value and identify the employer, the team, the customer base, and sometimes individuals.

**The review (run on the drafted text before each Write/Edit of a lesson):**

1. **Inventory every identifier** in the draft. Walk the text and list each: service/module name, company/product name, ticket prefix or ID, branch/plan/PR slug, person name, customer/market list or country-code list, internal hostname/URL/wiki link, exact count, and date.
2. **For each, run the load-bearing test:** "If I replace this with a generic role or category, does the rule lose any enforceable meaning?" Examples of replacement: a service name → "the target service"; a company name → "the company"; a ticket ID → drop it; a country list → "the new markets"; a person → "a reviewer" / "the author"; a wiki URL → "an internal wiki page"; an exact incidental count → "many". If the rule is unchanged, the identifier was fingerprint  -  redact it. If removing it genuinely weakens the rule, keep it but flag it for step 4.
3. **Identifier-class awareness (not a closed list  -  a shape guide):** the classes that most often leak because they *feel* like legitimate context, but almost never are:
   - Service/product/company names and their prefixed slugs (`<employer>-<product>-service`)
   - Ticket-system prefixes and IDs (`PROJ-123`, `<EMPLOYER>-456`)  -  the prefix alone identifies the employer's tracker
   - Customer/market enumerations (country codes, region lists)  -  these fingerprint the customer base
   - Person names, handles, and GitHub logins
   - Internal hostnames, domains, and wiki/Confluence URLs (even with the org redacted, a real space key or page path can identify)
   - Exact counts and dates tied to a specific private run (keep only when the count/date IS the rule, e.g. a byte budget)
4. **Backstop  -  deny-pattern cross-check:** after the review, run the repo's hygiene deny-pattern file (`public_hygiene_patterns_file` in facts) against the draft. Treat any hit as a definite redact. This catches identifier classes the judgment review might still rationalize away. Note: the deny-pattern file is itself an incomplete enumeration; the judgment review in steps 1-2 is the primary defense, not the pattern file.
5. **Escalate true load-bearing cases:** if a sensitive identifier genuinely cannot be removed without gutting the rule (rare), escalate to the user before writing  -  present the rule with and without the identifier and let the user decide. Do NOT silently publish a load-bearing private identifier.
6. **Residual-domain test (run after redaction).** After steps 1-5 have redacted identifiers, run the residual-domain test: does the rule **still require a specific application domain** (tax reporting, capital-gains calculation, FIFO lot matching, batch-row aggregation) to be meaningful? If yes  -  even with every proper noun redacted  -  the lesson is **fork (4) project-specific**, not fork (2) stack guidelines and not fork (3) UL. A rule like "post-aggregation validation must run after all groups are accumulated, not per-row" survives identifier redaction yet still assumes batch-row processing with mid-accumulation state, so it is project-specific. Route it to the incident repo's project corpus (`docs/maintenance/development_lessons.md`), not the UL corpus and not `jvm_guidelines.md`. If the residual test says **no** domain dependence but the rule only applies inside one language or JVM/Spring/Python ecosystem, that is fork **(2)** shared language/JVM guidelines, **not** fork (4). Do not use "framework semantics" alone as proof of project scope when the framework is the shared stack (Spring, Reactor, Mockito). Step 1.2 item 3b's incident-repo-vs-cwd pre-check is the high-recall first gate; this residual-domain test plus Step 1.2 item 4b stack-portability is the second-layer reinforcement.

**Keep without question:** public playbook artifacts the rule operates on (`done` SKILL Step 2.76, `check-no-em-dash.sh`, `ruff`)  -  those are this repo's own content, not employer context. The generalized principle, shape trigger, rule steps, and cross-references to other public lessons/docs are likewise kept in full.

**Self-application:** If a lesson is later found to have leaked a private identifier, that is a learn-skill output defect. Fix the lesson, then ask which layer failed: did Step 1.2 item 1c not prompt the interrogation (root cause = generalization), or did the agent skip/rationationalize the Step 1.7 review (root cause = review discipline)? Strengthen the failed layer; do not just add the new token to a list.

## Step 2: Placement Rules

**First:** Read path keys from the opening TOML block in `.ai-playbook/facts.md` (see `using-skills` Step 0). Use resolved paths for the rest of this run; do not invent layout.

### Fork-4 project-corpus existence check (mechanical gate  -  required before ANY corpus write)

If the chosen scope from Step 1.2 item 4 is **fork (4) project-specific**, verify the incident repo's project corpus exists BEFORE any corpus write. This is the enforceable backstop that makes the Step 1.2/1.7 judgment checks mechanically binding: a filesystem/facts lookup, not LLM judgment.

1. Resolve the project corpus path: `$REPO/docs/maintenance/development_lessons.md`, where `$REPO` is the **incident repo** (per Step 1.2 item 3b) and the relative path comes from the repo's `project_guidelines_rel` / `repo_facts_rel` in `.ai-playbook/facts.md`. Use the incident repo, not necessarily the cwd repo.
2. Check existence (filesystem): if that file does **NOT** exist, the placement **FAILS LOUD**. Do not silently fall back to the UL corpus. Choose one:
   - **(a)** bootstrap the project corpus in the incident repo (`docs/maintenance/development_lessons.md` with the convention header, and add `project_guidelines_rel` to that repo's facts if missing), then write the lesson there;
   - **(b)** `cd` to the incident repo and re-run `learn` so Step 1.2 item 3b's incident-repo == cwd-repo check passes and the lesson lands in that repo's project corpus;
   - **(c)** escalate to the user and defer the capture.
3. **Playbook-repo special case (the contamination vector):** the playbook repo (`skills_repo_path` / `instructions_repo`) has **no** `project_guidelines_rel` and **no** project corpus of its own  -  it is not a project, it is the skills/instructions home. Therefore any fork-4 (project-specific) lesson learned while cwd is the playbook repo **MUST fail-loud** and be deferred to the incident repo's project corpus. Writing a project-specific incident into the UL corpus just because the UL file is the only corpus available in the playbook cwd is exactly the bug this gate exists to prevent.

This check is mechanical on purpose: even if the Step 1.2 item 3b judgment pre-check and the Step 1.7 item 6 residual-domain judgment test are both missed, this filesystem lookup cannot be rationalized away  -  a missing `development_lessons.md` is a missing file, full stop.

### Guideline file roles (resolve from facts keys only)

At learn start, read `user_facts_path`. Skills must **not** hardcode machine paths for guideline masters.

| Role | Facts key | Edit when |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Cross-project JVM/coding | `shared_docs_dir` + filename | Universal or JVM/Spring rule |
| Company master | `company_guidelines_master` | Cross-repo company convention |
| Company repo mirror | `company_guidelines_repo_mirror_rel` | Sync only: after master edit; never canonical |
| Project (current repo) | `project_guidelines_rel` | Repo stack/domain rule |

**Company rule workflow:** edit `company_guidelines_master` first, then sync mirrors in affected company repos. **Multi-tier generalization** (JVM + company + project) updates each canonical home, not the repo mirror alone.

### Facts vs skill configuration (required before adding keys or constants)

Use this split when capturing lessons or extending agent automation:

| Belongs in **facts** (`user_facts_path`, ownership facts, repo `repo_facts_rel`) | Belongs in **skill** (`SKILL.md` for the owning workflow) |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Machine paths and workspace roots | Workflow steps, gates, and completion criteria |
| GitHub accounts, domains, employer-specific identifiers | Numeric policy constants (byte budgets, loop limits, timeouts) |
| Repo path keys (`plans_dir`, `tmp_dir`, `project_guidelines_rel`) | Placement ladders and qualification gates for that skill |
| Local-only script locations that vary by machine | Default script **behavior** and mode names (`check`, `gate`) |
| Hygiene deny-pattern files (local regex lists) | When to invoke a script and how to interpret exit codes |

**Do not** add facts keys for portable policy the skill already owns (for example instruction byte budgets; define the number in `learn` / `done` Step text, not in `user_facts_path`). **Do not** duplicate skill workflow rules in facts.

When a user corrects "that should live in the skill, not facts", treat it as a **skill-scope** lesson: update the owning skill and `agent_workflow_guidelines.md` §50 if the split was unclear; do not re-home the constant into facts under another key name.

### Temporary artifacts
- Temporary artifacts belong under resolved `{tmp_dir}` (typically `docs/tmp/` when present).
- Do not create session scratch outside `{tmp_dir}` unless project-guidelines documents another gitignored scratch root.
- By end of run, delete temporary artifacts or promote them into canonical docs.
- Resolved `{proposals_dir}` is durable pre-canonical review, not temporary; do not move/delete there unless the user asks.
- Canonical exceptions (never treat as temporary): paths the project marks as durable in `project_guidelines_rel` or `AGENTS.md`.

### BEST_PRACTICES scope
Only place content in the project best-practices doc (resolve path, often `docs/maintenance/best-practices.md` or legacy `docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md`) if it is:
- understandable without system internals
- useful to humans outside incident context
- not LLM-reasoning correction text
- not generic troubleshooting filler
- not module/subsystem specific

### Module/system knowledge
- Internal behavior details belong in the **canonical home** documented by the project (`docs/architecture/<topic>.md`, `docs/maintenance/<topic>.md` after migration, per resolution).
- On **company services** with migration-complete signal ([`doc-hierarchy`](../doc-hierarchy/SKILL.md)): do **not** create new `docs/<module>/` or `docs/domain/` trees; route to architecture topics or `maintenance/`.
- Before migration-complete: legacy `docs/<module>/` may still exist for reads only; do not extend module-split trees; suggest `doc-hierarchy-migrate`.
- Prefer extending existing canonical docs.
- If no suitable canonical doc exists, create one in the layer/folder the project hierarchy specifies; if undocumented, ask the user or suggest updating `project_guidelines_rel`.
- Never place module internals in human best-practices docs.

### LLM examples/playbooks
- Place LLM-only examples in the project-resolved path (`caller_catalog`, `{tmp_dir}`).
- On company services **after** migration-complete: do **not** create new files under `docs/examples/`; merge into `caller_catalog` or use `{tmp_dir}`.
- Before migration-complete: legacy `docs/examples/<topic>.md` only when exploration confirms the repo still uses that layout.
- Split by module/domain so only relevant context is loaded.
- Every LLM example file must start with: `LLM examples - not human documentation`.
- Do not copy LLM examples into `docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md`.
- Do not embed LLM examples inside instruction-rule files.

### LLM instruction rules
- LLM reasoning-guard lessons belong in instruction rule files (`AGENTS.md` and command specs).
- Keep rules enforceable and concise.
- Do not place LLM reasoning guidance in `docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md`.
- Instruction files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) must remain language-agnostic. Language-specific patterns (Kotlin, Python, etc.) belong in the corresponding language guidelines file under the shared docs directory (from facts `shared_docs_dir`, e.g. `kotlin_guidelines.md`, `python_guidelines.md`), not in instruction files. When a lesson is language-specific, place it in the language file and add or update the reference in the instruction file's **Guidelines Loading** section.

### Exact class-name hygiene
- Do not hard-code exact test or implementation class names in canonical docs under `docs/` when a role/category description is sufficient.
- Do not hard-code exact class names in instruction files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) or command specs when the guidance is normative rather than operational.
- Prefer responsibility-based wording in those locations (for example "dedicated JSON naming/runtime guardrail test", "transport-slice test", "broader transport integration test").
- Exact class names are allowed only when they are operationally useful or intentionally canonical:
  - runnable single-test commands
  - migration checklists where file-level parity matters
  - places where the repo intentionally designates one canonical file/class anchor
- If a lesson is "this doc or instruction should not pin exact class names", place that as an enforceable instruction/command rule, not in `docs/maintenance/company-guidelines.md` (or legacy `docs/company-guidelines.md`) or other cross-repository baseline docs.

## Step 3: LLM Rule Qualification Gate
Before adding any rule, enforce all checks:
1. Rule vs fact: must prescribe/forbid behavior, not store a path, account, or environment value.
2. Facts vs skill: portable thresholds and workflow policy belong in the owning skill, not a new facts key.
3. Generalization: must apply to multiple future cases.
4. Preventive value: removing it should clearly increase risk.
5. Actionability: must say what to do or avoid.

If a candidate fails:
- rewrite once into a concise rule
- if still weak, discard it

## Step 4: Documentation Consolidation
Review and normalize under resolved doc roots (`docs/`, `{tmp_dir}`, and any example/caller-catalog path from resolution):

Required outcomes:
- one canonical document per topic
- subtopics as sections inside canonical docs (not fragmented duplicates)
- overview docs reference canonical docs instead of restating content
- no canonical docs referencing `docs/tmp/`
- workflow-spec docs contain workflow guidance only; do not append raw command outputs unless they improve the workflow itself
- canonical docs and normative instructions avoid brittle exact class-name references unless they are intentionally canonical or operationally necessary
- when changing the learn workflow itself, edit `~/.agents/skills/learn/SKILL.md` and commit in the skills repository (`skills_repo_path` in `~/.ai-playbook/facts.md`)

Topic-sibling update rule:
- When placing new content in any document, **scan all other docs in the repo** (`docs/`, instruction files, READMEs) for documents that already cover the same topic or a parent/sibling concept.
- If a sibling document exists (e.g., `docs/shell-functions.md` covers agent selection and you are adding a new agent-selection feature to `AGENTS.md`), update **both** documents in the same pass.
- Do not rely on cross-reference checks in later steps to catch this; the content must be placed in all relevant documents during the initial placement pass.
- Practical technique: after identifying the placement target, run `grep -rl "<topic keyword>"` across the repo to find sibling documents before writing.

Intra-document requirements:
- every non-trivial document starts with `Core Concepts`, `Key Concepts`, or `Terminology`
- define each core concept once
- later sections reference earlier definitions instead of re-defining

## Step 4.5: Add Cross-References for Lesson Discoverability

After placing a lesson in the project-resolved development-lessons path (for example `docs/maintenance/development-lessons.md` or a topic file under `docs/architecture/`), immediately add a cross-reference to the relevant instruction file (`CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`) so the lesson is discoverable when agents work on related code.

**Process:**
1. Identify which instruction section the lesson relates to.
2. Find the best location within that section, grouped with related rules for context.
3. Add a concise cross-reference to the resolved lesson doc path.
4. If the lesson introduces a new domain concept, update the matching **architecture** topic (for example `domain-model.md`) or `maintenance/<topic>.md`, not `docs/domain/` or `docs/<module>/` on migration-complete company services.

**Why this matters:** The instruction files are always loaded during tasks, but `development_lessons.md`
is loaded only when explicitly mentioned. Without cross-references, a lesson may exist in the corpus but never be
consulted when it's most relevant. Cross-references bridge this gap.

**Example:** Lesson #67 (Futures/Derivatives Liquidation Mechanics) should be referenced in the crypto capital gains
constraints section because that's where agents work with derivatives reporting. Lesson #68 (Decision Point Flags)
should be referenced near decision points and configuration rules.

**Topic-sibling check:** When adding a cross-reference, scan nearby rules for the same topic domain.
If multiple rules reference the same lesson, that's good; it reinforces the lesson's importance.
If you find a pattern where many lessons in one section all reference different docs, consider whether the lesson
could be consolidated or whether the instruction section could be reorganized for better flow.

## Step 5: Module Layout and Skill Workflow Lessons
- Module doc layout follows project resolution (`.ai-playbook/facts.md` path keys and `doc-hierarchy`): legacy `docs/<module>/`, flat `history/feature-notes/`, or architecture topics; do not impose a layout the project has not adopted.
- RFC / task tracker filenames follow project-guidelines or existing repo convention.
- If move/rename is required, propose minimal change set and ask for consent before applying. On company services with legacy layout, suggest `doc-hierarchy-migrate` instead of ad-hoc moves.

For lessons about a skill's workflow/style or output/content requirements:
- update the owning skill's `SKILL.md`
- add an example/playbook only in the project-resolved example path when one is needed to demonstrate the rule
- do not treat rewriting generated artifacts as the primary fix
- do **not** place these in resolved `project_guidelines_rel` / company mirror paths (`docs/maintenance/project-guidelines.md`, `docs/maintenance/company-guidelines.md` after migration), or instruction files; those are for project engineering conventions, not skill behavior
- edit skills at `~/.agents/skills/` (runtime source; `~/.claude/skills` resolves to the same tree when symlinked)

**Skill-scope detection:** When a lesson explicitly mentions a skill by name or describes a workflow that clearly belongs to a skill (e.g., "plans must investigate...", "execute-plan should...", "review feedback requires..."), detect this as a skill-scope lesson. Apply dual placement:
1. Place the generalized lesson in the project's `development_lessons.md` with cross-references
2. Also update the skill's `SKILL.md` under `agents/skills/<skill>/` in the skills repository (`skills_repo_path` in `~/.ai-playbook/facts.md`, or deduce via `readlink -f ~/.agents/skills`)

**Generalization before skill placement:** Before writing to a skill's `SKILL.md`, apply the generalization pass (Step 1.2) rigorously. Examples in skill files must be generic enough to apply across projects. Replace:
- Project-specific terms (e.g., "Koinly Other Gains Report", "FIFO matching") → generic equivalents ("Source Report A", "data matching algorithm")
- Concrete dates/IDs → placeholders ("2025-01-13" → "<specific date>")
- Domain-specific assets → generic concepts ("BTC/USDT" → "asset pairs")

**Commit workflow:** Commit skill changes in the skills repository (`skills_repo_path` in `~/.ai-playbook/facts.md`), separately from project changes with a clear commit message.

Examples:
- RFC section-content requirements belong in `rfc-design/SKILL.md` and `rfc-design/references/rfc-sections.md`
- done-workflow rules belong in `~/.agents/skills/done/SKILL.md`
- Investigation quality requirements belong in `~/.agents/skills/plans/SKILL.md` (not just in project docs)

### Skill Output Improvement (corrected/retracted/downgraded outputs)

When a skill's output was **corrected, retracted, downgraded, or significantly rewritten** after user feedback, extract lessons using these questions:

1. **What was the incorrect assumption?** (e.g. "assumed no downstream dedup guard", "assumed cache was still alive at call time", "assumed the user wanted verbose output")
2. **What verification step would have produced the correct output initially?** (e.g. "grep for dedup/idempotent in the downstream domain", "check TTL calculation and compare to method call timing", "re-read the user's original phrasing")
3. **Can the verification be encoded as a mandatory step in the skill?** If yes, it becomes a rule in that skill's `SKILL.md` or sub-agent prompts.
4. **Where in the skill does it go?** Map to the skill's internal structure:
   - Pre-execution checks / input validation steps
   - Core execution logic / sub-agent prompts
   - Post-execution assessment / quality gates
   - Output formatting / tone rules

**Trigger**: any of these patterns in the session:
- User corrects or overrides a skill's output
- Output severity/priority was changed (e.g. High to Low)
- Output was deleted or fully rewritten
- User challenges the feasibility or relevance of the output
- Suggested action was rejected as too costly, wrong-scoped, or unnecessary
- User says "but we already have X" or "that's not how it works"

**Placement guidance by skill type:**

| Skill | Where to place verification rules |
|-------|----------------------------------|
| `doing-code-review` | Sub-agent prompts (quality.md, concurrency.md, etc.) for domain checks; SKILL.md Step 4 for cross-cutting assessment rules |
| `rfc-design` | SKILL.md workflow gates; `references/rfc-sections.md` section template and editing checklist |
| `plans` | SKILL.md scope/estimation rules |
| `learn` | This file's extraction or placement logic |
| `done` | SKILL.md commit/cleanup rules |
| Other skills | The skill's own SKILL.md, in the step closest to where the error originated |

**Self-application**: this rule applies to the learn skill itself. If a lesson extracted by learn is later found to be mis-placed, mis-scoped, or incorrectly generalized, that is a learn-skill output correction and should be fed back into this section's placement/generalization logic.

## Step 6: Instruction File Updates

Update instruction rules only in the repo’s existing instruction sections (typical names: reusable engineering rules, repository style and conventions, repository constraints; exact headings vary by repo).

### Instruction placement ladder (required before any edit)

Resolve canonical homes from `user_facts_path` keys; never hardcode language, stack, or tool names in this ladder.

| Scope | Canonical home (facts key or path) | Always-loaded instruction file |
|-------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Cross-project universal | file under `shared_docs_dir` (for example `coding_guidelines.md`) | one-line cross-reference only |
| Stack or language ecosystem | appropriate file under `shared_docs_dir` | one-line cross-reference only |
| Company-wide | `company_guidelines_master` | one-line cross-reference only |
| Project / repo | `project_guidelines_rel` | one-line cross-reference only |
| Infrequent workflow | dedicated skill (`SKILL.md`) | remove from always-loaded instructions |
| Repo delta with no canonical home | (none) | full text allowed (keep concise) |

**Hybrid rule (mandatory):** When full rule text lives in a canonical tier, the instruction file gets **at most one line** (`see … #N` or equivalent pointer). Do **not** restate the same rule inline in the same bullet.

Placement test:
- reusable anywhere -> section 1
- repo consistency/look-alike -> section 2
- hard limit/prohibition -> section 3
- when unsure -> section 1

Instruction consolidation pass (required):
- Scan updated instruction files for overlapping bullets that prescribe the same behavior.
- Group overlaps into one canonical rule per intent; keep wording explicit and enforceable.
- Remove weaker/ambiguous duplicates instead of keeping multiple variants.
- If two rules are both needed, make scopes non-overlapping and clearly distinguish baseline rule vs exception rule.

Compaction pass (required):
- When an instruction rule restates or elaborates a convention already fully documented in company or project guidelines, replace the rule body with a compact reference (for example `see company-guidelines.md #N` or `see project-guidelines.md #N`) and keep only the incremental constraint or local exception in the instruction file. Edit the **canonical** file for the tier (`company_guidelines_master` or `project_guidelines_rel` per facts keys), not a repo company mirror alone.
- When a rule in a project-level instruction file (`repo AGENTS.md`) duplicates content already present in user-level instructions (`~/.codex/AGENTS.md`), remove the project-level duplicate or reduce it to a one-line cross-reference. User-level rules are always loaded; restating them per-project adds no enforcement value and creates drift risk.
- When adding a NEW project-specific technical or architectural convention (for example persistence configuration, test infrastructure pattern, schema layout, tool-specific settings), place the detailed content as a numbered rule in the current repo's project guidelines (`project_guidelines_rel` facts key) first; add only a one-line `see project-guidelines.md #N` reference in instruction files. Full-text rules in instruction files are reserved for cross-cutting reasoning guards that have no suitable canonical doc home.
- When adding a NEW cross-repository convention or baseline standard, choose the canonical home by scope. Read `user_facts_path` and resolve:
  - **Universal coding principle** (applies in any language, any company): `<shared_docs_dir>/coding_guidelines.md`
  - **Ecosystem-specific** (shared across JVM languages, Spring Boot patterns, Reactor/Mono): `<shared_docs_dir>/jvm_guidelines.md`, not in `coding_guidelines.md` because ecosystem rules are irrelevant to Python/Go/Rust projects.
  - **Language/framework-specific** (Kotlin stdlib idiom, MockK, Java Optional): `<shared_docs_dir>/kotlin_guidelines.md` / `java_guidelines.md` etc.
  - **Company-specific convention** (naming, error code format, logging policy shared across company repos but not universal): **`company_guidelines_master`** (facts key), not `company_guidelines_repo_mirror_rel`; sync repo mirrors after editing the master.
  - Do NOT default to company guidelines for general programming principles; that file is for company-specific conventions only.
  - Add only a one-line `see company-guidelines.md #N` reference in instruction files (repo-relative label for humans; canonical edit target remains the facts key).
- When multiple instruction bullets share the same governing principle, merge into one generalized rule with examples rather than keeping N specific variants.
- When a rule can be stated more concisely without losing its enforceable meaning, shorten it; prefer one-sentence rules over multi-sentence explanations.
- Byte-budget compaction fidelity audit: when rewriting or condensing an instruction bullet to fit the size budget, diff-audit the rewrite against its canonical source so every enumerated option, example, and qualifier survives (e.g. a three-option rule must not surface as two options; named fixture examples must not be dropped). Saving bytes never authorizes silently removing a rule element; if the element does not fit, move it to the canonical doc and leave a pointer.
- When an instruction rule is only needed for specific infrequent task types (for example Jira story creation, PR description writing, PR chunk splitting), move it to a dedicated skill such as `jira-pr-workflow` rather than keeping it in the always-loaded instruction files; add or update the trigger description in the skill's front matter.
- Do not remove a rule solely to save space; only when the canonical doc or a more general rule already covers it.

## Step 6.5: Instruction size gate (required before finishing learn)

Always-loaded instruction entrypoints (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and repo-root copies when present) are a fixed context budget, not a second canonical doc tier. Canonical guideline files (`project_guidelines_rel`, company master, `shared_docs_dir`) stay **on demand** (open only the sections or `#N` rules the task needs); compaction moves full rule text there and leaves pointers in entrypoints.

**Budget:** **30,720 bytes** per instruction entrypoint.

1. From the repo root, run:
   ```bash
   "${HOME}/.ai-playbook/scripts/check-instruction-size.sh" check
   ```
   (Override script path only for local testing via `INSTRUCTION_SIZE_CHECK_SCRIPT`.)
2. When **check** fails (any listed file exceeds the budget), run the compaction pass in Step 6 **in this learn run** until **check** passes: replace hybrid bullets with cross-references, move infrequent workflow rules to skills, and keep only repo deltas without a canonical home.
3. Do not finish learn while instruction files remain over budget after placement.

**Net-growth rule:** When adding a cross-reference to an instruction file, do not increase file size unless an equal or larger amount of redundant inline text was removed in the same learn run.

## Step 6.6: Corpus gates (required before finishing learn)

Two corpora, two gates:

| Corpus | Path | Gate |
|--------|------|------|
| **User-level** (cross-project, strict `UL#N`) | resolved from `shared_docs_dir` / runtime symlink | **Step 6.6 script** below (`lessons_index.py`) |
| **Project-level** (convention `#N`) | `docs/maintenance/development_lessons.md` | **Skill-gate learn class** (PreToolUse hook; refresh `learn.*.marker` before every Write/Edit per the skill-gate README) |

The project corpus IS skill-gate gated: absent or stale `learn.<project>.<session>.marker` blocks Write/Edit to `development_lessons.md` with `Invoke the learn skill before editing the project lessons corpus.` The user-level corpus is NOT skill-gate gated; it remains opt-in strict via the script gate in this step only.

**Commit ownership:** `learn` writes the corpus; it does not commit. When the project corpus path is **not** gitignored, `done` Step 3 item 4b must stage it on the feature branch. Do not treat orphan `docs` sync as a substitute for that commit.

### User-level lessons-corpus gate (script)

The user-level corpus is opt-in strict: lessons captured as cross-project (`UL#N`) must carry a `**Principle:** Family X` (or `Family excluded (<kind>)`) tag so the corpus stays grep-indexable and the `generalize` audit does not lose them. This subsection enforces that invariant on the **user corpus only** before learn finishes.

Resolve (do NOT reference the upper-case shared-docs-dir env var - it is not exported; the facts key is lowercase `shared_docs_dir`, and the upper-case form expands to empty, collapsing the path and silently tripping the missing-corpus cold-start guard):
- script: `script="${LESSONS_INDEX_SCRIPT:-${HOME}/.ai-playbook/scripts/lessons_index.py}"` (`LESSONS_INDEX_SCRIPT` override is local-testing only)
- user corpus: `user_corpus="${HOME}/Projects/.ai-playbook/development_lessons.md"` (runtime symlink, canonical-equivalent to the `shared_docs_dir` master)

Guards, in order:

1. **Drift precheck (warn-only):** if the repo source AND runtime copies exist AND `diff -q` differs for `lessons_corpus.py` OR `lessons_index.py` OR `lessons_adopt.py` OR `lessons_migrate.py`, warn naming the drifted script(s) and give the `cp` repo->runtime recipe; continue. If the repo source is absent (runtime-only deployment), emit a WARNING (not a silent note) that the gate's own integrity is unverified and continue. Warn-only because blocking would deadlock the very `learn` that could fix the drift.
2. **Missing-script cold-start:** `[[ -f "$script" ]]` or warn "gate script absent; install via the playbook repo" and exit 0.
3. **Missing-corpus cold-start:** if the user corpus file does not exist (playbook not cloned / convention not adopted at user level yet), warn "user-level corpus absent; see `coding_guidelines.md` #17; run `lessons-migrate` to seed it" and exit 0.
4. **Zero-tag cold-start:** if the user corpus has zero family tags, warn "convention not adopted in user corpus" and exit 0.
5. **Adopted (blocking):** run `"$script" "$user_corpus"`. On non-zero exit, print the recovery recipe ("classify the listed `UL#N` via learn/generalize, OR run `lessons_adopt.py --tag-unclassified <user_corpus>` manually, then re-run `learn`") and **block** (exit 1). `lessons_adopt.py` is a manual tool and is NEVER invoked automatically - do NOT route it through `done`.

**Block propagation (r4 Medium 4):** `learn` is invoked by `done` Step 1 as a SKILL (a sub-procedure, not a subprocess whose exit code `done` checks). "Step 6.6 blocks (exit 1)" therefore means the `learn` skill returns `blocked` to its caller; `done` Step 1 treats a blocked `learn` as a Step-1 failure (does NOT proceed to Step 2 commit) and falls through to `done`'s Step 6 lock-release. The operator fixes the user corpus out-of-band before the next `done`. A standalone `learn` (not under `done`) must NOT trigger `lessons_adopt.py`.

**Strictness trade:** a `learn` in any project blocks on a user-corpus violation because the user chose strict user-level. The corpus is single-user-local, so a block means "fix the user corpus", not "fix this repo". This is intentional: one strict corpus enforces the tag invariant across every project's `learn` run.

**Project-tier dup check (warn-only, no script):** project `development_lessons.md`: optional `grep -oE '^## [0-9]+' <project_corpus> | sort | uniq -d` (warn-only). Project corpus writes are enforced by the skill-gate learn class at edit time, not by this script step.

### Lesson concision gate (required before finishing learn)

Lessons are reference material read mid-task, not prose to admire. A lesson that rambles gets skimmed and the rule is lost  -  the failure mode the `i-have-adhd` skill exists to prevent. Before finishing, apply this gate to every new or substantially edited lesson (user-level `UL#N` and project `#N`):

1. **Word budget:** a single lesson block should sit near the corpus median, not multiples of it. After drafting, `wc -w` the block (from its `## N.` header to the next `## ` header). If it is more than ~1.5× the median of the last 10 same-corpus lessons, tighten it. The Principle/Trigger/Rule/Why/Shape/Example/See-also skeleton stays; the *words inside each* get cut.
2. **One discriminator, not three.** A lesson may need one "Distinguishing from #X" subsection when a sibling lesson is a near-miss. Two or more discriminator subsections is a sign the lesson is bundling multiple principles  -  split it, or fold the distinctions into the General form line.
3. **No restating the rule in the example.** The Example section shows the incident; it must not re-derive the rule. If the Example paragraph restates Rule steps, cut the restatement.
4. **Sentences under control.** No sentence should run past ~40 words. Long compound sentences with multiple em-dash/parenthetical asides are a red flag  -  split them. (Apply the `i-have-adhd` shaping rules: lead with the next action, number multi-step rules, cut tangents.)
5. **Title under control.** The `## N.` title is a scannable label, not an abstract. If it exceeds ~12 words or contains a semicolon, shorten it (the detail belongs in Principle/Rule, not the header).

This gate is blocking: if a lesson is over budget after one tightening pass, either cut more or split the lesson. Do not finish learn with an over-long lesson in the corpus.

## Step 7: API Contract Naming Hygiene
When lessons involve external API naming or endpoint shape:
- Prefer resource-oriented OpenAPI paths and avoid RPC verb segments (`/set`, `/check`, `/resolve`, `/merge`, `/unsuppress`).
- Use kebab-case for multi-word path segments and consistent module-aligned roots.
- Record old-to-new endpoint mapping and rationale in canonical docs (`docs/project-decisions.md`) as documentation-only deprecation context.
- If API path or `operationId` renames were already made in the implementation workflow, verify docs remain synchronized with those changes; do not perform implementation refactors as part of this learn workflow.

## Completion Checklist
Before finishing, verify:
- lesson placement is complete and unambiguous
- no temporary artifacts remain outside policy
- no `docs/` references to `docs/tmp/`
- no duplicate concept definitions inside changed documents
- instruction-rule updates are grouped/deduplicated with no overlapping or contradictory bullets for the same intent
- no instruction rule restates a convention already documented in full in company or project guidelines; full text lives in the canonical file for that tier (`company_guidelines_master`, `project_guidelines_rel`, or `shared_docs_dir` file per facts keys); instruction files hold only the incremental constraint or a reference
- no project-level instruction rule duplicates a rule already present in user-level instructions (`~/.codex/AGENTS.md`); project-level copies are reduced to a cross-reference or removed
- every new full-text rule added to instruction files is either (a) a cross-cutting reasoning guard with no suitable canonical doc home, or (b) already has its detailed content in the tier-appropriate canonical guideline file with only a `see … #N` reference in the instruction file
- Step 6.5 instruction size gate passed: `"${HOME}/.ai-playbook/scripts/check-instruction-size.sh" check` exits 0 from the repo root after compaction
- Step 6.6 passed: user-level `lessons_index.py <user corpus>` exits 0 (or warn-only cold-start); project corpus gated by skill-gate learn marker refresh before each Write/Edit
- Step 1.2 item 1c applied: every proper noun/identifier in the incident was interrogated for load-bearing status and generalized to a role/category where the rule held without it
- Step 1.7 proper-noun justification review passed: the drafted lesson was re-read, every identifier ran the load-bearing test, employer fingerprints (service/company/ticket/customer-list/person/URL/count/date) were redacted to generic roles, and the deny-pattern backstop raised no hits; only public playbook artifacts and genuinely load-bearing details remain
- incident-repo == cwd-repo verified for every `UL#N` capture (Step 1.2 item 3b), OR a deferred capture was routed to the incident repo's project corpus; AND the fork-4 project-corpus existence check (Step 2 mechanical gate) ran for every project-specific candidate  -  no project-specific incident was written into the UL corpus on the grounds that the UL file was the only corpus available in the current cwd
- Step 6.6 concision gate passed: every new/edited lesson sits near the corpus word-count median (≤1.5×), has at most one Distinguishing subsection, and the title is ≤~12 words
- no hybrid bullets remain where canonical tier already holds the full rule text
- no new facts keys added for portable policy constants that belong in a skill (see Step 2, Facts vs skill configuration)
- exact class names appear only where operationally useful or intentionally canonical; normative instructions and canonical docs use role-based wording instead
- if the learn workflow changed, `~/.agents/skills/learn/SKILL.md` is updated and committed in the skills repository (`skills_repo_path` in `~/.ai-playbook/facts.md`)
- RFC-workflow lessons updated in skill/example files where applicable
- changed API docs and OpenAPI artifacts remain synchronized
- the learn counter file (`/tmp/learn-counter-${PPID}-<dir_hash>`) has been deleted so the nudge timer restarts

## Integration Points

### With `bootstrap-ai-playbook` skill
Writes and refreshes `.ai-playbook/facts.md` when Terms triggers fire (`using-skills` Step 0). This skill reads documentation path keys from that file during lesson placement.

### With `agents-best-practices` skill (provider)
`learn` is the operational feedback loop for this playbook: it turns recurring failures into durable docs, enforceable rules, and mechanical checks. `agents-best-practices/references/agent-legibility-feedback-loops.md` describes the general harness pattern (source-of-truth artifacts, validators, garbage collection). When auditing or designing a harness, read that reference; when a concrete failure occurred in this session, run `learn`.
