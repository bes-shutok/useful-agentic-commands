  Create, edit, or structurally review Design RFCs in Markdown. Use for design RFC, feature design,
  architecture RFC, API design, or /rfc-design. Full Technical Design Documents (fixed sections 1-11)
  use tdd-design. Modes: create (full intake), edit (existing file), review-local (Step 2 only).
  Hosted-page reviews: use review-confluence-doc. Publishing or synchronizing to Confluence: use confluence-page-sync.
  Creation uses intake gates, then draft plus tiered review-agents pass before final output.

# rfc-design: Generate MVP Design RFC (Implementation-ready, succinct)
# Intent: Produce a concise, actionable, implementation-ready RFC suitable for linking into Jira stories.
# Note: Skill verbosity is acceptable. Output must be succinct and implementation-oriented.

**Writing:** Follow `agent_workflow_guidelines.md` §45. Audience is typical backend engineers, not only authors who already know the domain or security jargon. Prefer plain English that a BE peer can read without a glossary. When a project-specific, networking, or security metaphor still earns its place for concision (for example survivor, tombstone, fail closed), it must appear in `# Terminology` before body use. Concision alone does not exempt undefined jargon. Transport/code docs may keep "wire format" where the team already uses it.

## Core Concepts
- Hard gate: a mandatory stop point where RFC generation cannot continue without explicit user confirmation.
- Coverage checklist: a pre-generation scope contract that confirms in-scope surfaces and MVP boundaries.
- Canonical ID: the single identifier returned by resolve-style APIs for downstream composition.
- Server-owned field: state/audit field (for example `updated_at`, version) set by the service, not by client input.
- Core vs custom properties split: core cross-tenant dimensions are first-class fields; tenant-defined extensions are a flexible map.

## When to Use

| User intent | Mode | Skill path |
|-------------|------|------------|
| Create or draft a new Design RFC | **Create** | Steps 0 → 0.1 → 1 → 2 → 3 |
| Update an existing Markdown RFC file | **Edit** | **Read this skill + `references/rfc-sections.md` first**; skip Steps 0–0.1 unless scope changed; apply editing checklist; run Step 2 (Light) when edit is substantial **or** after a formatting/readability cleanup pass (formatting alone misses contract gaps). Use targeted edits (`StrReplace`), not full-file overwrite, on large RFCs. Step 2.5 applies to edit-mode folds too. |
| Review a local Markdown RFC only | **Review-local** | Step 2 on the provided draft; no regeneration |
| Create a Technical Design Document (TDD) | **Redirect** | `tdd-design` (fixed sections 1-11 completeness gates) |
| Review an RFC/TDD on Confluence | **Redirect** | `review-confluence-doc` (fetch page, review and comment only) |
| Publish or sync an RFC/TDD to Confluence | **Handoff** | `confluence-page-sync` (page updates, Mermaid integrity, ledger) |
| Turn an approved RFC into an implementation plan | **Handoff** | `plans` skill; reference the saved RFC path in the plan header |

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the rfc-design skill in **{mode}** mode."

**Do not use** for implementation plans (`plans`), code review (`doing-code-review`), Confluence page review (`review-confluence-doc`), Confluence publishing (`confluence-page-sync`), or Technical Design Documents (`tdd-design`).

## Workflow Overview

| Phase | Step | Hard gate? | Output |
|-------|------|------------|--------|
| Intake | Step 0 – Input collection | Yes | Input inventory only |
| Intake | Step 0.1 – Assumptions and coverage | Yes | Coverage checklist for user confirm |
| Draft | Step 1 – Generate RFC draft | No (after gates) | Full RFC sections 1–8 per structure below |
| Review | Step 2 – Review pass (sub-agents) | Tiered (light default; full on request) | Staging review file under `{reviews_dir}/`; revised RFC |
| Verify | Step 2.5 – Post-fold verification round | Yes, whenever blocking findings were folded | Fresh staging round `-r<N>` over the post-fold RFC bytes |
| Deliver | Step 3 – Finalize | No | Markdown RFC only (findings folded in; no separate review artifact in chat) |
| Handoff (optional) | After Step 3 | No | Offer `plans` when user wants implementation planning |

**Section template:** Read `references/rfc-sections.md` when drafting §1–8, Technical Decision Notes, or editing an existing RFC. Read `references/contract-blueprint-example.md` before drafting or revising **§5 Contracts**.

## Documentation paths (doc-hierarchy aligned)

Read path keys from the opening TOML block in `.ai-playbook/facts.md` (see `using-skills` Step 0; `bootstrap-ai-playbook` when triggers fire). Do **not** hardcode `docs/rfcs/`, `docs/plans/`, or module-split trees.

| Key | Role | Post-migration default (Layer 3) |
|-----|------|----------------------------------|
| `{rfcs_dir}` | Canonical **Design RFC** files (history, flat) | `docs/history/feature-notes/` |
| `{proposals_dir}` | Pre-canonical RFC **drafts** only (optional) | `docs/history/feature-notes/proposals/` or legacy `docs/proposals/` |
| `{reviews_dir}` | RFC review staging docs and `.stats.json` sidecars | `docs/reviews/` |
| `{tmp_dir}` | Session scratch (not review staging) | `docs/tmp/` |

**Save location rules:**

1. Resolve `{rfcs_dir}` from facts; use the on-disk path only (bootstrap never invents paths).
2. **Doc-hierarchy migration-complete repos:** save finished RFCs as **flat files** under `{rfcs_dir}` (Layer 3 history). Prefer `{SERVICE}_rfc.md` or `{feature}-rfc.md` per `doc-hierarchy/migration-map.md`. Do **not** create `docs/rfcs/` at `docs/` root; verify script flags that as a migration failure.
3. **Legacy repos (pre-migration):** if `docs/rfcs/` still exists on disk and facts point there, save there until **doc-hierarchy-migrate** runs; do not create new legacy roots on repos already on the three-layer layout.
4. **Work-in-progress drafts** the user has not approved for the history corpus: `{proposals_dir}` when that key exists; otherwise ask before writing under `{rfcs_dir}`.
5. **Placement questions** (RFC vs architecture topic vs investigation note): read `doc-hierarchy` skill; RFCs are Layer 3 feature notes, not Layer 2 architecture topics.

**Review staging** (Step 2) always under `{reviews_dir}/YYYY-MM-DD-rfc-review-<slug>-<mode>.md` per `review-staging`, never under `{rfcs_dir}` or `{tmp_dir}/rfc-review/`.

Generate a **Design RFC** in **Markdown format**.

The **output must be Markdown only**.

The RFC must be:
- succinct and skimmable
- actionable for implementation stories (API, DB, logic)
- implementation-ready to the level achievable with the provided inputs

Do NOT include generation-time reasoning, meta commentary, or attribution.

---

## Terminology (Mandatory)

Place **`# Terminology`** (or `# Dictionary`) at the **very beginning** of the document. It is the **only** block before **`### 1. Header`**. Numbered sections 1–8 and any **Addendum** sections follow Header.

### Reader-facing glossary (not writer instructions)

The Terminology block is for **readers** implementing the RFC. It is **not** a place for authoring policy, eval-ban tables, jargon-usage essays, or "if you meant X use Y" disambiguation matrices. Those belong in project guidelines, agent skills, or feature working notes.

**Allowed in Terminology:**

- One optional intro sentence (e.g. two concepts that must not be confused).
- A **flat, alphabetically sorted** bullet list: one term per bullet, short clear definition.
- Jargon and abbreviations (e.g. tombstone, DLQ, MQ) when defined here before first body use.

**Forbidden in Terminology:**

- Topic subsections (`#### People and audience`, `#### Filters and bitmaps`, etc.).
- Writer meta tables or prose ("Use them when they are unambiguous", "Do not use eval").
- Operator matrices, catalog tables, or long comparative notes (move to **Addendum** at document end).

**Body prose:** Do not use ambiguous catch-alls (e.g. **eval**, **evaluation**) as a stand-in for distinct operations. Name the **one** operation: operator preview, segment membership, rule compilation, snapshot build, bitmap maintenance, list count/page. Agent-centric working notes may keep **eval** for brevity.

### What to define

- Explain terms (including abbreviations) that may be ambiguous, security-sensitive, or domain-specific.
- Prefer rewording metaphors that are uncommon for backend readers (for example API "ingress"/"egress") into request/response wording. If the metaphor stays, define it here.
- Define coined contract phrases used as nouns in rules or flows (for example semantic no-op, merge lineage, crypto-shredding) even when they are concise.
- Do NOT explain universally known technical terms (API, HTTP, JSON, DB, UI).

Must be explained if used: RBAC, SSO, IAM, PII; company/product abbreviations; cross-domain abbreviations whose meaning is not obvious; project lifecycle metaphors (survivor, tombstone) and security shorthand (fail closed, cryptographic oracle) when the body keeps those words.

### Format

- Bullet list; **bold term** first; one short definition per bullet.
- Sort entries **A–Z** by the bold term (ignore leading "The").
- No repetition of full definitions elsewhere in the document; body may use the term once defined.
- Do not bold cross-references or emphasis inside a definition; use plain words for other glossary terms already defined above.

### Bold and emphasis (§1–8 and Addendum)

- **Terminology only:** bold the term label at the start of each glossary bullet (`- **Term**:`). Nowhere else in the RFC.
- **Body sections:** use `####` / `#####` headings to partition content. Do not bold glossary terms, operation names, or whole sentences for emphasis.
- **Code and literals:** use backticks for field names, operators, table/column names, and wire values.
- If a block needs visual separation, add a heading; do not substitute bold paragraphs.

### Addendum (supplementary material)

After **`### 8. Testing & Rollout`**, optional **`### Addendum A.`**, **`### Addendum B.`**, … for material that supports the RFC but is not a glossary entry:

- Operator / filter matrices (e.g. MVP filter operators D24)
- Naming rationale tables (e.g. `HAS_OCCURRED` vs `EXISTS`)
- Accepted risks overflow when §8 is already dense

Addenda use the same heading rules as §1–8 (see `references/rfc-sections.md`).

---

## Document structure and headings (Mandatory)

Read `references/rfc-sections.md` for the full section template. Summary:

| Level | Use for |
|-------|---------|
| `# Terminology` | Glossary only (before §1) |
| `### N. Section title` | Numbered sections 1–8, Addendum |
| `#### Subsection title` | Problem statement, Goals, In-scope, Contract notes, Critical tests, … |
| `#####` | Per-endpoint examples under §5.1, per-event under §5.2 |

**Subsection rule:** Inside `### 2. Problem, Goals, Non-goals` (and §3, §5, §7, §8, etc.), use **`#### Subsection title`** plus a blank line, then bullets or prose. Do **not** use nested list labels (`- Problem statement:`) or bold inline titles (`**Goals:**`) as pseudo-headings; they do not separate visually in Confluence or Markdown previews.

**Edit mode (mandatory):** Before changing an existing RFC, read this skill and `references/rfc-sections.md`, then run the **Editing checklist** in `rfc-sections.md` before presenting the update. **Diagrams:** if any edited §4 flow meets a complexity trigger (≥3 decision branches, concurrent actors racing on shared state, or a cross-trust-boundary handoff), ensure a fenced Mermaid diagram exists under that flow or the §3 N/A one-liner is present; do not leave a blanket "no diagrams" stance on a now-complex flow.

**Title alignment:** When an RFC title is authoritative in an external source such as Confluence, verify that source and preserve its exact reader-facing wording unless the user explicitly requests a rename. Do not introduce internal glossary terms or ticket-led framing into the title as a substitute for that source wording.

---

## Step 0 – Input Collection Mode (Hard Gate)

Inputs may be provided via:
1) CLI/context arguments supplied to the tool (preferred when present)
2) Repository documents discovered by searching the repo (preferred when available)
3) Inline pasted text in chat (fallback)

Required inputs (as text available in the current context, from any of the above sources):
- PRD (full text or relevant excerpts)
- High-level architecture (full text or relevant excerpts)
- Relevant service documentation (including subfolders) or key excerpts
- Any existing API contracts / schemas / DB schemas that are relevant (if they exist)

Hard gate rules:
- Until the user gives an explicit "go ahead" signal, you MUST NOT generate any part of the RFC (no section drafts, no outlines, no partials).
- In this mode, you may ONLY:
  - list what inputs are missing
  - ask targeted questions to obtain missing details
  - request specific missing excerpts ONLY if they are not present in CLI/context arguments and cannot be found in the repo 
  - restate what was received in a short inventory (no interpretation)

Proceed signal:
- Only start generating the RFC after the user explicitly indicates readiness, e.g. "OK, proceed", "Go ahead", or "Generate the RFC".

**Fast path (skip separate Step 0 inventory):** When the user already attached or pointed to PRD + architecture (+ contracts when APIs/events/DB are in scope) **and** said to proceed, draft, or generate, treat Step 0 as satisfied. Produce Step 0.1 coverage checklist in the same message (do not wait for a second turn unless a blocking gap remains).

---

## Step 0.1 – Assumptions & Coverage Confirmation (Hard Gate)

After all inputs are provided (but before generating the RFC), produce an **Assumptions & Coverage** checklist for user confirmation.

The checklist MUST include:
- In-scope surfaces for THIS RFC:
  - Backend / Frontend / Mobile (iOS) / Mobile (Android) / DevOps-Infrastructure
- MVP scope boundaries:
  - explicitly in MVP
  - explicitly deferred (if stated)
- Which RFC sections will be present with real content vs "Not applicable for MVP"
- Any inferred scope decisions marked `(TODO: confirm)`
- Any missing technical decisions that block implementation-ready details
- **Capacity addendum applicable?** (API CPU / payload expansion / shared DB instance / import-or-burst contention): yes → plan `### Addendum <letter>. Throughput and storage footprint`; no → record the §3 N/A one-liner from `references/rfc-sections.md` Addendum
- **Complex-flow diagrams applicable?** (≥3 decision branches, concurrent actors racing on shared state, or cross-trust-boundary handoff): yes → list candidate §4 flows; no → covered by diagram N/A one-liner
- **Encrypted edge-auth path in scope?** (API gateway / platform authorization with encrypted traffic): yes → require encrypted-direction diagram under §3 or §4; no → covered by diagram N/A one-liner

Hard gate rules:
- Do NOT generate any RFC sections until:
  1) the checklist is produced, AND
  2) the user confirms the checklist AND gives the Proceed signal.

**Fast path:** When the user message includes both complete inputs and an explicit proceed/generate signal, present the checklist and start Step 1 in the same turn after a one-line assumption summary. Do not block on a second confirmation unless the checklist contains `(TODO: confirm)` items that block implementation-ready contracts.

---

## Global Inference Rules (Mandatory)

Inference is allowed, but controlled.

Rules:
- Do NOT infer:
  - ownership, authority, approvals, or named stakeholders
  - compliance regimes (e.g. GDPR) unless explicitly in the inputs
- If database engine is not specified, use **generic SQL** for DDL where possible and mark engine-specific parts as `(TODO: confirm)`.
- If you include engine-specific SQL examples while the decision is pending, label them as examples and add a one-line portability note.
- When referencing internal repository documents, use document names (in parentheses) and do not use file paths or Markdown links to internal `.md` files.
- Before including an external URL in a canonical document, verify it is accessible; if verification cannot be performed or fails, do not include the URL.
- Do not mix inferred and sourced facts in the same bullet.
- Use `(TODO: confirm)` when a decision must be confirmed.
- Use `(TODO: define)` when a detail is required to implement but not provided.
- For resolve-style endpoints, default to returning only the canonical identifier unless trace details are explicitly required.
- Keep server-owned fields out of client-write request examples unless override semantics are explicitly required by inputs.
- When modeling flexible attributes, separate core cross-tenant dimensions from tenant-defined custom properties.

---

## Global Succinctness & Actionability (Mandatory)

Rules:
- Prefer concrete bullets over narrative.
- **Succinct vs telegraphic:** Bullets must stay skimmable **and** self-contained for readers who land mid-document (§4 edge cases, §6 rules, §7 alerts). Succinct is short with complete meaning; telegraphic drops subjects, uses undefined jargon, or hides thresholds (e.g. "alert if ≥3 in 24h" without saying **what** is counted). When a term is in Terminology, still spell out the behavior once in edge cases and operability rows (table/column names OK).
- **§5 Contracts:** prefer **implementation blueprints** (JSON request/response bodies, event payloads, DDL/SQL) over wordy explanations. If a fact is not in a fenced example, it is not implementation-ready. Minimum bar: `references/contract-blueprint-example.md`.
- **Separate protection domains:** when a design applies similar security mechanisms at different trust boundaries, give each domain its own contract subsection with key ownership, format, lifecycle, and failure policy. Describe cross-domain interaction in a separate end-to-end flow so shared vocabulary does not imply shared keys or rotation semantics.
- **Complex-flow and encrypted-path diagrams:** when any applicability trigger in `references/rfc-sections.md` §4 fires (≥3 decision branches, concurrent actors racing on shared state, a cross-trust-boundary handoff, or an encrypted edge-auth hop), a fenced Mermaid `flowchart` or `sequenceDiagram` is required. Encrypted edge-auth designs must show expected ciphertext vs cleartext directions, using only participants and hops the architecture inputs support. Numbered steps stay normative; the diagram is an aid. If no trigger applies, record the §3 N/A one-liner. Mermaid `sequenceDiagram` message text must not contain `;`.
- **Alternative-branch MVP gates:** when a flow shares mechanics across alternative constructions, state each branch's applicability, MVP or post-MVP status, and exact activation trigger before the shared steps. Mirror those distinctions in comparison tables and diagrams so deferred behavior cannot be read as an MVP requirement.
- Every bullet must be either:
  - a requirement
  - a decision
  - a contract
  - a dependency
  - or an implementation task input
- Do NOT list obvious/generic statements unless explicitly required by provided inputs.
- Keep non-contract sections short; §5 endpoint inventories are expected to be complete, not minimal.
- Use stable headings so Jira stories can link to specific sections.

---

## Step 1 – Generate RFC Draft

After Step 0 and Step 0.1 gates pass, draft all RFC sections in one pass per `references/rfc-sections.md`. Do not run Step 2 until the draft is complete (all sections present or marked "Not applicable for MVP").

## Skill Ownership for RFC Lessons

When a lesson changes RFC authoring workflow, section content requirements, or review-checklist expectations:
- update this `rfc-design` skill or `references/rfc-sections.md` at the relevant section
- add an example/playbook only when needed to illustrate the rule; use project-resolved path from `.ai-playbook/facts.md` TOML (`caller_catalog`, `{tmp_dir}`, or legacy examples dir if the repo still has one)
- do not treat editing an individual module RFC as the primary fix unless the underlying skill rule is already correct

---

## Step 2 – Review Pass (Sub-Agents, Tiered)

After Step 1, read `review-panel-selection.md` and launch the selected workers in parallel.

### Review depth

| Depth | When | Workers |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Light** (default) | MVP RFC, first draft | Focused panel with explicit selection reason |
| **Full** | User says full review, or high-impact cross-domain design | All five recommended workers |
| **Skip** | Trivial config/doc tweak, or user says "skip review" | None |

User may request **Full** explicitly; do not default to Full without a signal.

### Hard gates

1. **Launch the selected workers before revising the RFC.** Do not skip the pipeline because the draft "looks fine."
2. **Write the staging review file** under `{reviews_dir}/YYYY-MM-DD-rfc-review-<rfc-slug>-<mode_or_round>.md` and the matching `.stats.json` sidecar before folding findings into the RFC. Include `## Review Statistics` per `review-staging`. Version-1 sidecars dated on or after `EXTENDED_SIDECAR_MIN_DATE` must carry the freshness fields `review_mode`, `risk_signals`, `prior_findings_filter`, and `last_fix_commit`; see `review-staging` for the contract and the min-date fence.
3. **Mechanical gate (before folding findings into the RFC):** run the review-staging validator on the staging path; do not proceed to folding until the staging doc and its `.stats.json` sidecar both pass:
   ```bash
   VALIDATOR="${REVIEW_STAGING_VALIDATOR:-$HOME/.ai-playbook/scripts/validate_review_staging.py}"
   python3 "$VALIDATOR" --hard "$STAGING_PATH"
   ```
4. **Fold findings into the RFC structure** (Step 3). Do not present a separate premortem or review report in chat; print only a short summary and the staging file path.
5. **Partial review gate:** when any required worker fails after one relaunch, write staging but do not claim a full review.
6. **Post-fold verification gate:** when the fold revised any section for a `blocking: true` finding, run Step 2.5 before Step 3. The fold is an unreviewed edit to the artifact under review; a pre-fold clean panel is not evidence that the folded text is correct.

### Budget (default)

- Full depth launches the recommended five-worker panel once **per round**.
- Light depth may use a focused panel with a recorded selection reason.
- Allow one relaunch per failed worker; keep the failed and replacement launches visible in statistics.
- The hard ceiling is six actual launches **per round**, including descendants and escalation.
- At most three verification rounds (Step 2.5). If blocking findings remain after the third, stop and report the residuals to the user instead of folding again.
- Before stopping at that cap, or whenever the same root issue recurs or a fold regenerates findings, invoke `review-reconciliation` with the staged history and RFC digest. After any reconciliation change, `rfc-design` runs a fresh Step 2.5 review with its normal worker selection; reconciliation cannot certify its own change.
- Apply the shared finding budget after deduplication.

### Orchestrator boundary

| Do | Do not |
|----|--------|
| Launch agents, wait, parse returns, dedup, write staging file with Review Statistics | Re-analyze the RFC inline while agents run |
| Fold accepted findings into RFC sections per severity map | Re-read source inputs to expand thin agent findings (relaunch the agent instead) |
| Spot-check a claim only when evidence is missing or contradicts a quick grep | Author full analysis the agent should have returned |

**Insufficient sub-agent output:** relaunch the responsible agent with a focused prompt ("expand finding N with quoted RFC section and concrete fix").

### Launch workers in parallel

Each agent receives:
1. Full RFC draft from Step 1
2. Original inputs from Step 0 (PRD excerpts, architecture, contracts) when available for evidence checks
3. Its assigned lens catalogs from `review-agents/`
4. The shared severity and finding-budget policy
5. **Execution framing:** review what the RFC proposes, quote evidence, report problems only, and return the shared finding fields plus `descendant_launches`.

#### Worker bundles

Use `review-panel-selection.md`:

| Worker | RFC focus |
|--------|-----------|
| `correctness-completeness` | Logic, flows, requirements, contracts, compatibility |
| `testing` | §8 coverage of §4 flows and §6 rules |
| `design-simplicity` | Architecture boundaries and avoidable complexity |
| `contract-docs` | Documentation plus RFC consistency checks below |
| `risk` | Security baseline plus signaled concurrency and premortem reasoning |

#### RFC consistency lens inside `contract-docs`

Review the RFC draft for internal contradictions:

1. §2 goals vs §3 scope vs §4 flows
2. §4 flows vs §5 contracts vs §6 rules
3. §5.2 event consumers vs §5.4 downstream impact
4. §8 tests vs §4 edge cases
5. Terminology vs body usage (undefined terms, conflicting names; glossary must be flat A–Z with no writer meta; supplementary tables in Addendum not Terminology)
6. Subsection headings (`####` / `#####`) vs pseudo-headings (nested `- Label:` bullets, bold paragraphs, or `Edge case:` plain lines without `#####`)
7. Bold usage (glossary term labels only in Terminology; body must not re-bold defined terms)
8. Technical Decision Notes vs chosen approach elsewhere
9. **§4 edge cases** use **Edge case: \<title\>** plus Condition / Behavior / Outcome (and Notes when needed); not one-line telegraphic bullets
10. **§4 edge cases, §6 rules, §7 metrics/alerts** restate behavior in plain language (table/column names OK); thresholds name **what** is counted and the **time window** (e.g. "3+ PARTIAL runs in rolling 24h", not "≥3 in 24h" alone)
11. **Capacity addendum**: when any Addendum trigger applies (API CPU / payload expansion / shared DB instance / import-or-burst contention), `### Addendum <letter>. Throughput and storage footprint` exists with sources-of-truth labels (`established` | `planning assumption` | `illustrative`); otherwise the §3 N/A one-liner is present. Illustrative idle-box CPU must not be described as a release green without a shared-load measurement gate.
12. **Complex-flow diagrams**: when any diagram trigger applies (≥3 decision branches, concurrent actors racing on shared state, or a cross-trust-boundary handoff), the affected flow has a fenced Mermaid diagram or the §3 N/A one-liner is present. Blanket "no diagrams" guidance must not cover a flow that now meets a trigger.
13. **Encrypted edge-auth directions**: when an edge-auth or gateway hop carries encrypted traffic, a §3 or §4 diagram shows expected ciphertext vs cleartext directions; prose-only hop lists are not enough. Every participant and hop in the diagram must be traceable to the architecture inputs; flag added intermediaries on paths the inputs describe as direct. Mermaid `sequenceDiagram` messages must not contain `;`.

Return the shared finding fields with the two contradicting statements quoted.

### Conditional lenses

See `review-agents/review-panel-selection.md` for canonical rules. Summary:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| RFC describes async, queues, `@Transactional`, or multi-threaded flows | Load `concurrency.md` in `risk` |
| Premortem signals match or user says `include premortem` | Load `premortem.md` in `risk`; personas remain reasoning sections |
| RFC is trivial config or documentation-only (see skip rules) | Skip entire Step 2 |
| User says "skip review" | Skip Step 2 |
| User says "full review" | Use **Full** depth |

### Staging review file format

Write under `{reviews_dir}/` using the universal `review-staging` hierarchy and shared severities.

Minimum `## Review Statistics` content per `review-staging`: Panel (Solo/Echo columns), Counts, Deduplication groups, Discarded findings (with Pattern), Severity calibration, Triage placeholder. Each staged finding lists **Agents**, **Pattern**, and **Source** `[Prose]` / `[Premortem]` / `[Code]` when applicable.

```markdown

```

Dedup before folding: when two agents describe the same root issue, keep the clearest fix, record the merge in **Deduplication groups**, and discard extras with reason `duplicate` or `severity-merged`. Drop findings already addressed in the draft (`already-mitigated`).

### Fold into RFC

| Finding | RFC action |
|----------------|------------|
| `blocking: true` | Revise the cited RFC section before final output |
| Non-blocking behavioral risk | Add the concrete safeguard to §8 Testing and Rollout |
| Operability risk | Add the concrete metric, log, or alert to §7 |
| Accepted residual risk | Add a brief Accepted Risks item |

**Skip Step 2 and Step 2.5 when:**
- The RFC is a trivial configuration change or documentation-only tweak
- User explicitly requests skipping review

**Harness regression:** Read `references/eval-cases.md` when auditing this skill or after a Step 2 or Step 2.5 gate failure.

---

## Step 2.5 – Post-fold Verification Round

Run after every fold that revised a section for a `blocking: true` finding. Skip only when the fold touched nothing but Terminology ordering, heading shape, or other formatting with no normative content change.

### Exit condition

Stop iterating when **one fresh round over the current post-fold RFC bytes** returns zero unresolved `blocking: true` findings **and** that round required no fold. A round that produced fixes is not an exit round; the fixed text has not been reviewed yet.

### Round composition

Read `review-panel-selection.md` and launch:

- `correctness-completeness` always.
- Every worker that owned a staged finding in the previous round.
- Every worker whose domain the fold touched, judged by the sections the fold rewrote, not by the finding that triggered it. Rewriting a flow for a `risk` finding puts that flow back in scope for `correctness-completeness` and `testing`.
- `design-simplicity` on the exit round when earlier rounds only folded contracts, tests, or prose. Do not exit on `contract-docs` and `risk` cleanliness alone after §4 flows or §5 contracts were rewritten.

Give each worker the post-fold RFC, the previous round's staging file, and the instruction to review the current text on its own merits rather than grading the previous fixes.

### Fold-induced defect classes to check explicitly

The fold writes new normative text under time pressure and is the most likely source of these:

1. New text contradicts a section the fold did not touch (a new test assertion against a deferred metric, a new flow step against an existing non-goal).
2. A fix names a mechanism without specifying its ordering, durability, or failure policy, leaving the next layer of the same gap.
3. A rewritten flow acquires a lock, a remote call, or a transaction boundary that the original flow did not have.
4. A fix applied at the first cited anchor while sibling instances of the same defect elsewhere in the RFC still carry the old wording.

### Mechanical digest gate

Each round's sidecar `source_digest` must be the SHA-256 of the exact RFC bytes **that round reviewed**, so a fold invalidates the previous round's digest by construction. Verify before reporting a round complete:

```bash
VALIDATOR="${REVIEW_STAGING_VALIDATOR:-$HOME/.ai-playbook/scripts/validate_review_staging.py}"
STAGING_PATH="{reviews_dir}/YYYY-MM-DD-rfc-review-<slug>-r<N>.md"
RFC_PATH="{rfcs_dir}/<rfc-file>.md"
python3 "$VALIDATOR" --hard "$STAGING_PATH" --source-rfc "$RFC_PATH"
```

`--source-rfc` recomputes the RFC's SHA-256 and fails hard if it differs from the sidecar's `source_digest`, and type-checks the sidecar's `source_kind` is `rfc`. Pass the RFC path on every round, especially after folds: a readiness claim recorded against a pre-fold digest fails the gate and cannot be reported as round-complete. Do not report the round complete or proceed to Step 3 until the check passes. If the installed validator lacks `--source-rfc` (stale install), refresh it from `scripts/validate_review_staging.py` in the playbook repo first  -  do not fall back to a hand-rolled digest compare.

### Round bookkeeping

Verification rounds use `-r<N>` in the staging filename (`...-<mode>-r2.md`, `-r3`, …) and set `Round:` plus `Prior:` in Metadata. Count a round only after its findings are triaged and every accepted blocking finding is folded. After three verification rounds with blocking findings still open, stop and hand the residuals to the user.

## Step 3 – Finalize

**Precondition:** Step 2.5 reached its exit condition, or the fold was formatting-only, or the user explicitly stopped the loop. Never finalize on a pre-fold clean panel.

1. Apply severity map revisions to the RFC draft.
2. Re-scan Terminology for terms introduced during revisions.
3. Run the editing checklist in `references/rfc-sections.md` when modifying an existing file.
4. Present **Markdown RFC only** to the user (no generation-time reasoning, no meta commentary).
5. Print to console: staging review path for the exit round, round count, counts by shared severity, partial-review flag if applicable, and one-line readiness note.

---

## Final Output Contract

- Output Markdown only.
- Follow the RFC structure exactly (Sections 1–8).
- Succinct, actionable, implementation-ready to the level achievable from inputs.
- No filler, no generic best practices, no compliance assumptions unless explicitly in inputs.
- Respect the hard gates:
  - Step 0 (input collection only)
  - Step 0.1 (assumptions and coverage confirmation before generation)
  - Step 2 (review pass before final RFC unless skip rule applies)
  - Step 2.5 (post-fold verification round whenever blocking findings were folded)

## Integration Points

### With `review-agents` skill (review pass)
Step 2 launches the five worker bundles from `review-panel-selection.md`; `contract-docs` includes the RFC consistency lens.

### With `review-staging` skill
Consumes `review-staging` for path pattern `{reviews_dir}/YYYY-MM-DD-rfc-review-<slug>-<mode_or_round>.md`, required `## Review Statistics`, and matching `.stats.json` sidecar. Write staging before folding findings into the RFC; do not use `{tmp_dir}/rfc-review/`. A `--hard` validator gate runs over the staging path before findings are folded into the RFC. Each round records `source_kind: "rfc"` and a `source_digest` over the exact RFC bytes that round reviewed; Step 2.5 rechecks that digest against the file on disk so a pre-fold review cannot be reported as an exit round.

### With `premortem` skill
The `risk` worker reads the premortem catalog when signals match and applies personas as internal reasoning sections without child launches.

### With `review-confluence-doc` skill (redirect)
Reviewing a Confluence-hosted RFC/TDD: use `review-confluence-doc` (fetch page, structured feedback, optional comment posting). It is review-only; it does not publish or update pages. This skill owns **local Markdown** authoring; it does not fetch Confluence.

### With `confluence-page-sync` skill (publication)
Publishing or synchronizing an RFC/TDD to Confluence: hand off to `confluence-page-sync`, which owns page updates, Mermaid diagram integrity, and the sync manifest ledger. This skill owns local Markdown authoring; the Confluence page is a rendered derivative of the repository document, never the source of truth.

### With `review-plan` skill
Implementation plans derived from an RFC use `review-plan` at execution time. This skill's Step 2 reviews the RFC design artifact, not the downstream plan.

### With `review-reconciliation` skill
Use reconciliation for non-converging verification rounds, recurring root issues, and contradictory staging or digest evidence. `rfc-design` remains the original orchestrator and owns the fresh post-refactor review and finalization gate.

### With `plans` skill (handoff)
After Step 3, when the user wants implementation work, offer the `plans` skill. Reference the saved RFC file path (under resolved `{rfcs_dir}`) in the plan header.

### With `grilling` skill
Use before drafting or after a first RFC draft when design choices need explicit user sign-off. Grilling resolves decisions one at a time; do not duplicate RFC body content in chat. Reference the saved RFC path once it exists.

### With `doc-hierarchy` skill (placement)
RFCs are **Layer 3** history (`{rfcs_dir}`, typically `docs/history/feature-notes/` flat). Do not file them under Layer 2 `docs/architecture/` or legacy `docs/rfcs/`. Read `doc-hierarchy` for layout rules; run **doc-hierarchy-upkeep** when the RFC changes user-visible behavior documented in Layer 1/2.

### With `agents-best-practices` skill (reference)
For harness-level questions (approval gates, tool permissions, eval strategy for RFC quality), read `agents-best-practices/references/evals.md` and `security-observability.md`. Regression cases for this harness live in `references/eval-cases.md`. This skill owns the RFC document contract; that skill owns general agent harness design.
