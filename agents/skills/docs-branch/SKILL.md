# Docs Branch: Preserve Gitignored Docs and Instructions

## Core Concepts

- **Gitignored LLM artifacts**: `docs/`, `.github/docs/`, `/.ai-playbook/` (repo root only), `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `COPILOT.md`: files that provide LLM context but are excluded from the main working branch via `.gitignore` to avoid polluting the code history. **Default:** add `/.ai-playbook/` to repo `.gitignore` (see `bootstrap-ai-playbook` skill). Use `.git/info/exclude` only when `.gitignore` cannot be committed (for example during a code review on a branch that cannot touch `.gitignore`).
- **Snapshot backup**: A plain temp-directory copy of shadow paths, taken before syncing. Never use `git stash push --all` for ignored shadow files because it removes them from disk.
- **`docs` orphan branch**: A single permanent local branch with no code history that stores the full history of all gitignored doc changes across all feature branches. Never pushed to remote.
- **Single-branch invariant**: The shadow history for gitignored docs must live on one branch named exactly `docs`. Branches such as `docs/master` or `docs/<feature>` are incorrect and must be consolidated back into `docs`, not reused.
- **Add-only sync invariant**: The `docs` branch sync never treats a missing on-disk file as a deletion. Sync adds or updates paths present on disk only. Paths tracked on `refs/heads/docs` but absent from disk are restored from that branch before sync (unless the path was explicitly deleted in the latest `docs` commit). Review directories (`{reviews_dir}` and fallbacks such as `docs/reviews/`, `docs/history/reviews/`) always follow this rule. **tmp sweep exception:** `{tmp_dir}` (fallback `docs/tmp/`) is the ONE sweep-eligible root: a path under it that is tracked on the branch, absent on disk, not explicitly deleted, not staged for deletion or rename in the live index, and still gitignored (committed tmp paths are restored like any other branch-tracked content) is DROPPED from the branch (staged as a deletion) instead of restored, because `{tmp_dir}` is scratch with plan lifetime (see `done` Step 2.62 and `plans` **Plan Lifecycle** docs/tmp cleanup). Every other root, review directories above all, stays strictly add-only.
- **Temporary docs worktree**: A separate `git worktree` used for all `docs` branch operations. The live project checkout stays on the user's working branch and is only read from.

## Documentation paths

Read `{reviews_dir}`, `{tmp_dir}`, and related path keys from the opening TOML block in `.ai-playbook/facts.md` (see `using-skills` Step 0) **before** running the scripts below. Build candidate path lists from those values; do not rely on the hardcoded fallbacks when TOML keys are present.

A repo may also declare **extra shadow dirs** it wants preserved on the `docs` branch that are not under the standard `docs` tree (for example a personal-data directory like `resources/source/`). Set the optional `extra_shadow_dirs` TOML array in `.ai-playbook/facts.md` to a list of repo-relative paths. Entries may be gitignored files/directories or a container directory whose contents are ignored by rules such as `resources/source/*`; the sync treats `extra_shadow_dirs` as explicit preservation roots.

```bash
# After reading .ai-playbook/facts.md TOML: set REVIEWS_DIR and TMP_DIR from {reviews_dir} and {tmp_dir}
SHADOW_CANDIDATES=(docs/ .github/docs/ docs/personal/ .ai-playbook/ AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md GEMINI.md COPILOT.md)
[ -n "${REVIEWS_DIR:-}" ] && SHADOW_CANDIDATES+=("${REVIEWS_DIR%/}/")
[ -n "${TMP_DIR:-}" ] && SHADOW_CANDIDATES+=("${TMP_DIR%/}/")
# Fallback only when resolution was not run
[ -z "${REVIEWS_DIR:-}" ] && SHADOW_CANDIDATES+=(docs/reviews/ docs/history/reviews/)
[ -z "${TMP_DIR:-}" ] && SHADOW_CANDIDATES+=(docs/tmp/)
EXTRA_SHADOW_DIRS=()

docs_branch_add_shadow_candidate() {
  _candidate="$1"
  [ -n "$_candidate" ] || return 0
  for _existing in "${SHADOW_CANDIDATES[@]}"; do
    [ "$_existing" = "$_candidate" ] && return 0
  done
  SHADOW_CANDIDATES+=("$_candidate")
  EXTRA_SHADOW_DIRS+=("$_candidate")
}

docs_branch_append_extra_shadow_dirs_from_facts() {
  _facts_file="$1"
  [ -f "$_facts_file" ] || return 0
  # F3: fence string built via sprintf so this code block contains no literal triple backticks (keeps the block extractable from SKILL.md)
  _extra_raw=$(awk 'BEGIN{F3=sprintf("%c%c%c",96,96,96)} $0 ~ "^"F3"toml"{f=1;next} f && $0 ~ "^"F3{exit} f && /^extra_shadow_dirs[[:space:]]*=/{sub(/^extra_shadow_dirs[[:space:]]*=[[:space:]]*\[/,""); sub(/\].*$/,""); print; exit}' "$_facts_file")
  if [ -n "$_extra_raw" ]; then
    while IFS= read -r _item; do
      [ -n "$_item" ] || continue
      docs_branch_add_shadow_candidate "$_item"
    done <<EOF
$(printf '%s' "$_extra_raw" | tr ',' '\n' | sed "s/^[[:space:]]*//; s/[[:space:]]*$//; s/^['\"]//; s/['\"]$//")
EOF
  fi
  unset _facts_file _extra_raw _item
}

# Optional extra_shadow_dirs TOML array: additional repo-relative gitignored paths to preserve.
# Parse both live facts and the docs branch facts so a stale live facts file cannot
# silently drop already-configured shadow paths from future syncs.
docs_branch_append_extra_shadow_dirs_from_facts .ai-playbook/facts.md
if git show "refs/heads/docs:.ai-playbook/facts.md" >/tmp/docs-branch-facts.$$ 2>/dev/null; then
  docs_branch_append_extra_shadow_dirs_from_facts /tmp/docs-branch-facts.$$
  rm -f /tmp/docs-branch-facts.$$
fi
if [ -f /tmp/docs-branch-facts.$$ ]; then
  rm -f /tmp/docs-branch-facts.$$
fi
unset _candidate _existing
```

The `SNAPSHOT_PATHS` and `SHADOW_PATHS` loops below use `SHADOW_CANDIDATES` instead of a fixed dual-layout list.

## When to Use

- Called from the `done` skill as Step 2 (before committing).
- Standalone when you only need to sync docs to the `docs` branch (e.g., after a big doc update mid-session).
- When restoring missing docs after a branch switch wiped them.

## Step 1: Snapshot Gitignored Docs and Instructions

Snapshot all gitignored LLM artifact paths before syncing them to the `docs` branch. Only include paths that actually exist to avoid a fatal `pathspec did not match` error.

> **Important:** Do not use `git stash push --all` for this workflow. It removes gitignored files from disk, and an interruption before restore can leave content missing. The live checkout must remain on the user's working branch and must only be read from.

```bash
SNAPSHOT_TMP=$(mktemp -d)
SNAPSHOT_PATHS=()
# Build SHADOW_CANDIDATES per Documentation paths section above
for p in "${SHADOW_CANDIDATES[@]}"; do
  clean="${p%/}"
  if [ -e "$clean" ] && git check-ignore -q "$clean"; then
    SNAPSHOT_PATHS+=("$p")
    parent=$(dirname "$clean")
    mkdir -p "${SNAPSHOT_TMP}/${parent}"
    cp -Rp "$clean" "${SNAPSHOT_TMP}/${parent}/"
  fi
done
[ -e ".claude" ] && SNAPSHOT_PATHS+=(".claude/")
rm -rf "${SNAPSHOT_TMP}"
```

## Step 1.5: Preserve Active Execute-Plan Session Logs (when present)

When `{tmp_dir}/execute-plan/<plan-slug>/` exists with `manifest.md`, Step 2 includes it in the shadow snapshot without replacing the live `docs/tmp/` directory. **This logic is integrated into the Step 2 script below** (do not run Step 1.5 as a separate tool call).

Reference (for reading only, use Step 2 script):

```bash
# EXECUTE_PLAN_BACKUP cleanup runs inside Step 2 after SHADOW_PATHS is built.
```

## Step 2: Sync to the `docs` Branch

Create or update the single `docs` branch only when at least one of the candidate paths is both present on disk and gitignored. Skip entirely when the only ignored path is `.claude/` or another local agent config directory, those stay local-only.

A single permanent `docs` branch is used regardless of which feature branch is active, keeping the full doc history in one place without per-branch fragmentation. Create it as an **orphan** on first use so it carries no code history.

If the repository already contains any `docs/...` branches, stop and consolidate them into the single `docs` branch before continuing. Do not route new updates into `docs/master`, `docs/<feature>`, or any other namespaced variant.

> **Critical:** Run this entire script as a **single shell invocation**. Shell variables (especially `SHADOW_TMP` and `DOCS_WORKTREE`) do not persist between separate tool calls. Do not use `path` as a loop variable: in zsh it is a special array tied to `PATH` and breaks command lookup mid-script.

> **Target shell is bash, not zsh.** This script uses the `${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}` empty-array idiom (see UL#166 for the bash-3.2 hazard it defends against). That idiom is bash-portable but NOT zsh-portable: under zsh, when the array is empty, the guard expands to a single empty-string word and the `for x in ...` loop body runs ONCE with `x=""`, which then aborts at `${x:?}` (`zsh:<line>: <var>: parameter not set`) AFTER the worktree is created but BEFORE the commit, leaving no commit and a partially reset working tree. When the invoking agent's default shell is zsh (macOS default), paste the canonical text into a temp `*.sh` file with a `#!/bin/bash` shebang and invoke `bash <file>`; do NOT paste the body directly into a zsh shell tool call. (UL#189.)

> **Safety model:** Step 2 syncs through a separate temporary worktree. It must never checkout `docs`, run `git clean`, or delete shadow paths in the live project checkout.

```bash
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
DOCS_BRANCH="docs"

docs_branch_under_tracked_subtree() {
  _candidate_path="$1"
  _shadow_root="$2"
  _ancestor=$(dirname "$_candidate_path")
  while [ "$_ancestor" != "." ] && [ "$_ancestor" != "/" ]; do
    [ "$_ancestor" = "$_shadow_root" ] && return 1
    if git ls-files -- "$_ancestor" | grep -q .; then
      return 0
    fi
    _ancestor=$(dirname "$_ancestor")
  done
  return 1
}

# Explicit deletes: only paths removed in the latest docs commit may be dropped.

  _docs_parent=$(git rev-parse "refs/heads/${DOCS_BRANCH}^" 2>/dev/null || true)
  if [ -n "$_docs_parent" ]; then
    while IFS= read -r _del; do
      [ -n "$_del" ] || continue
      DOCS_EXPLICIT_DELETES+=("$_del")
    done <<EOF
$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=D "${_docs_parent}" "refs/heads/${DOCS_BRANCH}" 2>/dev/null)
EOF
  fi
fi
unset _docs_parent _del

    case "$_target" in "$_del"/*) return 0 ;; esac
  done
  return 1
}

# Add-only safety net: restore shadow files that exist on the docs branch but are
# missing on disk BEFORE sync. Without this, a file lost earlier (e.g. by a manual
# branch switch) would stay gone and never be re-synced. Reviews and all other
# shadow roots follow this rule. Fill-only; never overwrite existing on-disk data.
# A path the user has STAGED for deletion or rename is an intentional move, not
# data loss: it is never restored. Afterwards only the paths actually restored
# are unstaged; the reset must NEVER blanket the shadow roots (that unstaged the
# user's own staged git mv work; witnessed 2026-08-31).

> **Note:** When `docs/` is also a directory on the working branch, `git log --oneline docs` is ambiguous. Always use `git log --oneline refs/heads/docs --` to reference the branch unambiguously.

## Recovery: Restoring Missing Gitignored Files

Any manual `git checkout docs` (for history inspection, rebase, or reset) followed by `git checkout <feature-branch>` **will remove** `docs/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and other gitignored files from disk. Git removes files that were tracked on the previous branch even when they are gitignored on the new branch.

To restore after a manual branch switch:

```bash
# Restore from the docs branch without switching to it
git checkout refs/heads/docs -- docs/ AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md .ai-playbook/
# Unstage: these files must NOT be committed on the feature branch
git restore --staged docs/ AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md .ai-playbook/
```

Then run the full docs-branch skill (Step 1 + Step 2) to re-sync any pending changes.

### Last-resort: searching historical git stash entries

Older versions of this workflow used `git stash push --all`. That command stores gitignored files in the stash's **third parent** (`stash@{N}^3`). If gitignored files are missing after an old run, inspect stash entries before assuming permanent loss:

```bash
# List gitignored files stored in each stash entry (requires --all stash)
git ls-tree -r --name-only stash@{0}^3
git ls-tree -r --name-only stash@{1}^3

# Extract a specific file from a stash entry
git show stash@{0}^3:docs/tmp/my-file.md > docs/tmp/my-file.md
```

This only works when an old `git stash push --all` run happened after the files were created. Stash entries that predate the file's creation contain nothing.

## Rules

- Never use `docs/master`, `docs/<feature>`, or any other `docs/...` shadow branches. The only valid shadow branch name is exactly `docs`.
- If any `refs/heads/docs/*` branches already exist, consolidate them into the single `docs` branch and delete the namespaced branches before the next sync. Do not keep using them as a workaround.
- **Before running this skill, verify all candidate files are gitignored** (`git check-ignore -q <file>`). Repo `.gitignore` should include `/.ai-playbook/` (repo root only; see `bootstrap-ai-playbook`). If a file is untracked but not gitignored and you cannot commit `.gitignore`, add the path to `.git/info/exclude` (local-only fallback) before running the skill.
- Never switch the live project checkout to the `docs` branch during sync. Use a temporary `git worktree` for all `docs` branch operations.
- Run Step 2's script as a **single shell invocation**: never split across tool calls. Do not use `path` as a loop variable (zsh special variable).
- The `docs` branch is **never pushed to remote**: local safety net only.
- Create the `docs` branch as an **orphan** when it does not yet exist.
- **Never** include `.claude/` (or similar local config dirs) in `SHADOW_PATHS`: they stay local-only and are not synced to the branch.
- Build `extra_shadow_dirs` from the union of live `.ai-playbook/facts.md` and `refs/heads/docs:.ai-playbook/facts.md`. A stale live facts file must not remove already-configured shadow paths.
- **Add-only sync:** never treat a missing on-disk shadow file as a deletion on the `docs` branch. Restore fill-only from `refs/heads/docs` for every shadow root (including reviews) before sync. Only paths explicitly deleted in the latest `docs` commit may be removed from the worktree and staged as deletions. **Single exception (`{tmp_dir}`):** a path under `{tmp_dir}` (fallback `docs/tmp/`) that is tracked on the branch, absent on disk, not staged for deletion or rename in the live index, and still gitignored in the live repo is swept from the branch instead of restored, because `{tmp_dir}` is scratch with plan lifetime (`done` Step 2.62 sweep, `plans` **Plan Lifecycle** cleanup). Never widen this exception to `{reviews_dir}` or any other root.
- **Ephemeral tmp prune:** after the add-only overlay, remove stale `docs/tmp/*-cf-out.md` and `docs/tmp/**/__pycache__/**` from the temporary docs worktree when they are absent from the live checkout (`confluence-mirror-hygiene.sh docs-worktree-prune`). `done` Step 2.65 runs `audit-cf-out` first; cf-out is deleted only when hierarchy promotion is complete or the snapshot is STALE.
- Before syncing, restore any ignored shadow file that exists on the `docs` branch but is missing on disk (fill-only, never overwrite). This recovers content lost by an earlier manual branch switch and prevents the sync from dropping it from the `docs` backup. Paths staged for deletion or rename in the live index are intentional moves and are never restore targets; the follow-up unstage resets only the paths actually restored, never a blanket reset over the shadow roots (a blanket reset unstages the user's own staged work).
- Before staging on the `docs` branch, always strip LLM artifact gitignore rules and rules matching `extra_shadow_dirs` from `.gitignore` so the branch can track its own files. For a container root such as `resources/source/`, copy only ignored descendants that are not inside a tracked subtree; skip tracked or unignored children such as committed examples. Use `git add -f` when staging to also bypass any `.git/info/exclude` rules that may block adding gitignored paths.
- The live project checkout is read-only for shadow paths during sync. Copy shadow content to temp storage, then into the temporary docs worktree.
- **Never use `git stash push --all` or `git stash apply` for gitignored shadow files**: stash operations can remove ignored content from disk or restore only empty directories.
- **Never run `git stash clear`** in repos using this workflow, stash entries are the secondary backup layer alongside the `docs` branch.
- **Never delete shadow paths in the live checkout.** Deletes on the `docs` branch are allowed only for paths explicitly removed in the prior `docs` commit, and only inside the temporary docs worktree.
- **Nested git repos in SHADOW_PATHS** (e.g. `docs/personal/`): strip their `.git` inside the temporary docs worktree before staging (`find "$DOCS_WORKTREE" -mindepth 2 -name '.git' -type d | while read -r d; do rm -rf "$d"; done`). Without this, git treats them as submodule gitlinks and does not stage individual files.
- **Snapshot path correctness is data-loss critical**: `cp -Rp docs/foo SHADOW_TMP/` creates `SHADOW_TMP/foo/` (just the basename), NOT `SHADOW_TMP/docs/foo/`. Use the parent-preserving pattern everywhere: `parent=$(dirname "$src"); mkdir -p "${SHADOW_TMP}/${parent}"; cp -Rp "$src" "${SHADOW_TMP}/${parent}/"`. If the snapshot path doesn't match the worktree copy path, the sync silently omits content from the docs branch.
- **Never run whole-repo `git clean`** during docs-branch sync. The worktree implementation does not need it.
- **Preserve active execute-plan session logs** (`{tmp_dir}/execute-plan/<plan-slug>/` with `manifest.md`): the live checkout must remain untouched while the temporary docs worktree is updated.

## Integration Points

### With `done` and `plans` skills (docs/tmp sweep)
The `{tmp_dir}` sweep-eligible-root exception (Add-only sync invariant) exists to propagate `done` Step 2.62 (ownerless scratch sweep; it never touches `review-loop*`/`code-review/`/`handoff/` scratch) and `plans` **Plan Lifecycle** (plan-completion docs/tmp cleanup) deletions to the branch. Never widen the exception for other consumers.
