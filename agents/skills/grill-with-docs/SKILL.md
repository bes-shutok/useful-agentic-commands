# Grill with docs

Run a `grilling` session with `domain-modeling` active throughout the interview.

## Workflow

1. Read `domain-modeling/SKILL.md` Step 0 and resolve glossary and decision paths before the first question.
2. Follow `grilling`: one question at a time, recommended answer per question, facts from the environment not the user, no action until shared understanding is confirmed.
3. During the interview (not after), apply `domain-modeling` session rules:
   - Challenge terms against the glossary
   - Sharpen fuzzy language
   - Stress-test with concrete scenarios
   - Update the glossary inline when a term is resolved
   - Offer numbered ADRs when all three ADR criteria are met
4. When shared understanding is confirmed, summarize which doc files were created or updated and their paths.

Do not batch glossary or ADR updates to the end of the session.

## Integration Points

### With `grilling` skill
This skill is a documented combination of `grilling` plus inline `domain-modeling`. Do not replace either skill; invoke both behaviors in one user session.

### With `premortem` skill
After shared understanding and docs are captured, offer `premortem` for failure-mode analysis.

### With `execute-plan` skill
`execute-plan` Step 1.3b (Layer 2 documentation checkpoint) invokes this skill when the correct SOT owner, document role, or placement for documentation touched during execution is genuinely unclear; the checkpoint pauses for the grill instead of duplicating or contradicting existing docs. Same one-question-at-a-time and inline glossary/ADR rules as the `plans` Phase 1 path.

### With `rfc-design` / `plans` skills
`plans` Phase 1 invokes this skill through its confidence gate whenever an unclear requirement point is rated low-confidence; confirmed answers feed the plan's requirements buffer, while high-confidence points skip the grill and are listed in the plan's `## Assumptions` section instead. When the subject is a feature design or implementation plan, reference the RFC or plan path once it exists; write ubiquitous terms to the repo glossary, not duplicated into chat. The plans skill's Phase 1 scope-extension hard gate routes every proposed scope extension through this interview before the plan file admits it; record the in / split / defer decision inline per this skill's glossary and ADR capture. When the interview resolves a plans confidence-gate decision point, record the answer as a one-line receipt (decision, source, date) in the requirements buffer's Decision points requiring a grill subsection during the interview, not after it.
