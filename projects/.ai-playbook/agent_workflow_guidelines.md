# Agent Workflow Guidelines: Language-Agnostic

Canonical reference for generic agent workflow patterns observed across all projects
(work and personal). Instruction files reference numbered clauses here.

Some section numbers appear out of numeric order (historical inserts). Prefer section titles over numbers when a cross-reference might be ambiguous.

## 1. Multi-Direction Aggregation Testing

When implementing aggregation or grouping logic that processes records with different
subtypes (in/out, send/receive, credit/debit, buy/sell):

1.1. Write explicit test cases for EACH subtype BEFORE implementing.
Do not assume the aggregation logic is symmetric.

1.2. One direction may produce a single output from multiple inputs, while the reverse
produces multiple outputs from a single input. The aggregation code path is often
different for each direction.

1.3. When fixing an aggregation bug found in one direction, immediately add a test
for the opposite direction before touching the code. The fix is likely to regress it.

## 2. Review Agent False-Positive Protocol

When an automated review agent (quality, security, or requirements checker) reports
a critical or high-severity finding:

2.1. Run the relevant test or write a targeted reproduction BEFORE reading the code.
If the test passes, the finding is likely a false positive.

2.2. Do not spend time tracing code paths to verify a finding that a test run can
confirm or deny in seconds. Test-first verification is the cheapest filter.

2.3. Common false-positive patterns: claims of unreachable code in multi-branch
conditionals, claims of data not flowing correctly when tests assert the output,
claims of missing validation when upstream code already guards it.

2.4. Document confirmed false positives briefly in the review log so future review
iterations don't re-report the same non-issue.

## 3. Field Semantics: Prevent Role Confusion

When a data model has two fields with similar but distinct purposes
(e.g., one for matching and one for audit trail):

3.1. Document the distinction in a single canonical location (module docstring,
domain doc, or field-level KDoc/JSDoc). Do not scatter the semantics across
multiple files.

3.2. Never use one field to gate logic that belongs to the other, even if it
"simplifies" the code. The shortcut will be caught by review and require multiple
fix iterations.

3.3. When both fields carry dates, ensure the temporal ordering constraint is
explicit (e.g., `serviceStartDate <= validFrom`) and documented at the definition
site. Validate it in an init block or constructor when the language allows.

3.4. When renaming or repurposing a field, update every doc that defines its
semantics in the same commit, not just the code. Out-of-sync field semantics
between code and docs is worse than no docs at all.

## 4. Post-Refactoring Cleanup

After any code extraction, module split, or significant refactoring:

4.1. Run unused-import detection on the source module before committing.
Python: `ruff check <source> --select=F401,F811`. Kotlin: IDE inspection or
`./gradlew detektMain`. Java: IDE "unused declaration" inspection.

4.2. Search for duplicate function/method definitions in the source file.
Partial extraction often leaves the original alongside the import.

4.3. Run the full test suite after extraction, not just the new module's tests.
Import paths may break in distant consumers that aren't in the new module's
test scope.

## 5. Gitignored Docs: Code Comment References

When design docs (RFCs, plans) are gitignored and only live on the author's
machine (e.g. under `docs/history/feature-notes/`, `docs/history/plans/`, or legacy `docs/rfcs/` / `docs/plans/` before migration):

5.1. Code comments that reference design rationale must link to the shared
location (Confluence page URL, shared wiki, etc.), not the local file path.
Other team members and reviewers cannot see gitignored files.

5.2. When production code implements a constraint documented in an RFC with
explicit identifiers (e.g. §C4, §Rule 9), add a concise single-line inline
comment stating the rationale and linking to the shared RFC. This prevents
future contributors or agents from removing intentional design choices that
satisfy documented architectural constraints.

## 6. Formatting-Only File Detection in Branch Diffs

When cleaning up a branch diff to remove formatting-only files before a PR:

6.1. `git diff -w` (ignore whitespace) is insufficient. It misses ktlint and
auto-formatter changes that are semantically identical but structurally
different: trailing commas added/removed, multi-line ↔ single-line expression
wraps, import reordering, `when` block re-indentation, method chain splitting,
empty body removal (`{ }` → single-line), semicolon addition/removal, and
AAA scaffold comment removal (`// Arrange:`, `// Act:`, `// Assert:`).

6.2. The only reliable method is to read the full `git diff -- <file>` for
every changed file and classify each hunk manually. A file is formatting-only
when every hunk changes only tokens' arrangement, not their identity or count
(with the exception of trailing commas and semicolons, which are cosmetic).

6.3. Batch the analysis: first use `git diff -w` to find the obvious
whitespace-only files (zero `-w` diff), then inspect the remaining files'
full diffs for the patterns in 6.1. Do not assume a file with a small
`-w` diff has real changes; it may be entirely trailing commas.

## 7. Protect Non-Obvious Design Choices with Inline Comments

When code makes a non-obvious technical choice driven by an architectural
constraint (dispatcher selection, threading model, algorithm constant,
concurrency strategy):

7.1. Add a concise inline comment explaining *why* the choice was made, not
*what* the code does. Without this, future contributors or LLM agents will
"simplify" the code by removing the seemingly unnecessary complexity.

7.2. Include a link to the shared design document (Confluence, wiki) so the
rationale is verifiable. A comment that says "required for performance" without
a traceable source will eventually be questioned and removed anyway.

7.3. This is especially critical for choices that look like they could be
simplified but exist due to framework constraints (e.g. blocking I/O requiring
a specific dispatcher, ordering constraints in async pipelines, defensive
duplication of safety mechanisms across architectural layers).

## 8. Scope Discipline: No "While I'm Here" Changes

When implementing a task, do not make opportunistic improvements to files that
are not directly required by the current task, even if the improvements are
genuinely valuable.

8.1. Before modifying any file, verify it is in scope for the task. If a file
is not referenced in the task description, plan, or ticket, do not touch it.

8.2. Opportunistic improvements (adding try-catch wrappers, changing log
formats, reordering method calls, extracting constants) in unrelated files
create review noise, risk accidental behavioral changes, and trigger
unnecessary Copilot/reviewer comments that consume the author's time.

8.3. If you spot a genuine improvement in an unrelated file, note it for a
separate PR or follow-up ticket; do not bundle it into the current change.

8.4. Scope discipline applies within in-scope files too. When a file is in
scope, add only what was explicitly requested; do not add adjacent settings,
properties, or cleanup that wasn't asked for (for example, adding extra logging
rules to a config file because a sibling env file has them). Extra additions
inside an in-scope file are still scope creep.

## 9. Docker Tooling: Prefer Host Mounts Over Baked-in Scripts

When a Docker-wrapped tool (e.g. ralphex) needs agent wrapper scripts or config
that changes independently of the tool itself:

9.1. Symlink the entire scripts directory from the source repo into the tool's
config directory on the host (e.g. `~/.config/ralphex/scripts` → ralphex repo).
The Docker wrapper auto-mounts the config directory into the container. This
avoids image rebuilds on every script change: just `git pull` in the source repo.

9.2. Symlink the entire folder, not individual scripts. The active agent (copilot,
codex, gemini) is selected via config and may change later. Hardcoding to one
agent's script creates unnecessary image rebuilds when switching.

9.3. Config paths inside the container must use container-internal absolute paths
(e.g. ``~`-unsafe container paths like service-home config scripts/...`), NOT `~`-prefixed paths. The Go
binary does not expand tilde: `~` is treated literally and the command is not
found.

9.4. When updating Docker images after a base image pull, cached layers may
reference a non-existent parent snapshot. Run `docker builder prune` before
rebuilding, or use `--no-cache` to avoid stale snapshot errors.

## 10. Out-of-Scope Revert: Verify API Dependencies First

Before reverting a file classified as out-of-scope to a prior branch baseline:

10.1. Run `git diff <base>..HEAD -- <file>` and list every changed function/method
signature, parameter name, or property name in that file.

10.2. Search in-scope files for callers of each changed API. If any in-scope file
calls an API that was changed in the candidate file, the candidate is actually
in-scope; its change was required by in-scope code. Do NOT revert it.

10.3. A compile error immediately after reverting is hard evidence that 10.2 was
skipped. The correct fix is to un-revert the file (restore to HEAD state) and move
it from out-of-scope to in-scope in the plan's Review Scope section with a one-line
reason.

10.4. Cosmetic or formatting changes in a file that also contains a required API
change travel with that API change; they are not a separate justification for
reverting.

## 11. Failing Tests Are Always the Current Branch's Responsibility

There is no such thing as "pre-existing" or "unrelated infra integration test"
failures. If tests fail on the current branch, they must be fixed before the
work is considered complete.

11.1. A test that fails on the current branch is the current branch's
responsibility regardless of whether the branch introduced the failure
or inherited it from an earlier commit.

11.2. Do not dismiss failures with labels like "pre-existing", "flaky",
"infrastructure-only", or "unrelated". Each label is a deferral that will
eventually block merging or surface as a production incident.

11.3. If a test was already failing before the current change, the correct
action is still to fix it (or raise a separate ticket and fix it on this
branch), not to declare it out of scope.

11.4. The only exception is a test that is explicitly annotated and tracked
as a known skip (e.g. `@Disabled` with a linked ticket). If no such
annotation exists, the test must pass before merge.

## 12. Verify Test Execution Count After Adding @Test Methods

After adding one or more `@Test` methods to a test class, confirm the actual
number of tests executed by the runner matches the expected count.

12.1. If the runner reports fewer tests than expected, a method is being
silently skipped. Common causes: expression body with non-Unit return type
(see kotlin_guidelines.md #1), accidentally returning a lambda instead of
executing it (`= { ... }` vs `{ ... }`), or a broad catch block swallowing
an `IllegalArgumentException` thrown during test setup.

12.2. Use the runner's test-count output to verify. A silently skipped test
produces zero failures; the count mismatch is the only signal.

12.3. Apply this check whenever a test class is first created or when test
methods are refactored. Count mismatches are easy to miss in code review
because nothing appears broken.

## 13. Portable Shell Script Locking

Shell scripts intended for cross-agent use (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) must not
depend on `flock`: it is not installed on macOS by default and the failure is
silent when combined with `set -euo pipefail` and `|| exit 0` fallbacks.

13.1. Use `mkdir`-based locking instead: `until mkdir "$LOCK_DIR" 2>/dev/null;
do sleep 0.1; done` with a `trap 'rmdir "$LOCK_DIR" 2>/dev/null' EXIT` cleanup.

13.2. When a `flock` call silently exits via `|| exit 0`, the entire script
terminates before reaching any logic. The only symptom is that the script's
side effects never happen: no error, no output.

## 14. Agent-Specific Hook Protocol Wrappers

Different agents have different hook I/O protocols. Codex PostToolUse hooks
ignore plain text on stdout: they require JSON with `additionalContext` or
`systemMessage` fields. Claude Code hooks accept plain text on stdout.

14.1. When a shared script outputs plain text (e.g. a counter/nudge script),
create a thin agent-specific wrapper rather than modifying the shared script.
The wrapper handles protocol translation (plain text → JSON) and delegates to
the shared script.

14.2. Keep the shared script agent-agnostic. Agent-specific protocol concerns
belong in wrappers, not in the shared logic.

## 15. Out-of-Scope Findings: Document as Separate Ticket, Never Fix In-Place

**Scope: projects with peer review and shared codebases (e.g. company repos). Not
applicable to solo pet projects where fixing-as-you-go is fine.**

This rule applies at every stage: plan authoring, implementation, and code review.
Any finding (bug, security concern, quality issue, or improvement) that is not
part of the current task must be documented as a separate feature or bug-fix request,
not fixed on the current branch. This includes findings discovered while reading
code that is not being changed.

Rationale: fixing unrelated legacy code on a feature branch introduces untested
production risk (the fix may not be covered by existing tests), inflates PR scope,
and makes review harder, regardless of how legitimate the underlying concern is.

15.1. Do not fix the issue in-place on the current branch, even if the file is
listed as in scope. A file being in scope means the named methods are touchable;
it does not grant permission to modify any other method in that file.

15.2. Document the finding as a separate bug or feature ticket. Include the file,
the method or area, a one-line description, and where it was spotted. Decline any
review finding on out-of-scope code with "out of scope for this PR; tracked as
[ticket/note]".

15.3. When authoring a plan that partially touches a large file, explicitly name
the methods being modified and add a freeze note: "All other methods in this file
are frozen; reject any review finding that touches them."

15.4. Exception (trivially correct one-liner with no test surface): a genuinely
absent fix (e.g. a missing `log.error` in an exception handler that is clearly wrong)
may be kept on the branch if: (a) it is a single statement, (b) no new test is
needed to validate it, and (c) the user explicitly approves keeping it. This exception
is narrow: it does not apply to refactors, style changes, or anything requiring a
new test.

## 16. Merge-Time Compile Errors from Divergent Refactoring

When a squash merge or rebase produces a compilation error in code that was
moved from one class to another (e.g. a method moved from `EventBusImpl` to
`TriggerDispatcher`), the error may be a merge artifact rather than a bug on
either source branch.

16.1. Before propagating a merge-time fix to a source branch, verify the
source branch compiles independently. Check the branch's version of the
involved types (DTOs, interfaces, sealed classes) with
`git show <branch>:<file>`; do not switch branches to investigate; that
disrupts the merge state.

16.2. A compile error that appears only after merging is a merge artifact
when: (a) branch A moved code that constructs or uses a type, and (b) branch
B independently added required fields/parameters to that type. The fix
belongs only in the merged result; neither source branch has a bug.

16.3. To confirm: if the source branch's DTO lacks the fields that are
missing at the call site, the source branch compiled cleanly against its
own DTO and needs no fix. The merged branch needs the fix because it now
has the expanded DTO from the other branch.

## 17. Reading CI Test Output: Application Errors vs Test Failures

When reviewing CI (Jenkins/GitHub Actions) test run output:

17.1. Application-level `ERROR` log lines (e.g. `[com.example.Service:71]: input is invalid`) in test output are NOT test failures. They are emitted by the service's own logger while exercising invalid-input rejection paths, exactly as designed.

17.2. Actual test failures are reported by JUnit as `Failures: N` or `Errors: N` in the summary: `Tests run: N, Failures: N, Errors: N, Skipped: N`. A summary with `Failures: 0, Errors: 0` means all tests passed regardless of how many ERROR lines appear in the log.

17.3. When a user asks "why did CI fail with these?" for a set of test output, check the `Tests run` summary line first. If `Failures: 0, Errors: 0`, the CI failure was caused by something else (another test class, compilation error, downstream step), not the tests shown.

## 18. Skill Directory Sync: Include All Files, Not Just SKILL.md

When **creating** a new skill, add `LICENSE.txt` before the first commit: copy MIT `LICENSE.txt` from an existing skill (for example `agents/skills/plans/LICENSE.txt`). Personal email belongs only in the LICENSE copyright line.

When syncing or mirroring a skill directory between repos or to a home directory registry (`~/.agents/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`), copy every file in the skill folder: `SKILL.md`, `LICENSE.txt`, asset files, reference docs, and scripts. Copying only `SKILL.md` silently drops licensing metadata and support assets.

```bash
# Correct: copy entire directory
cp -r "$SRC/agents/skills/$skill/." "$DST/agents/skills/$skill/"

# Wrong: copy only SKILL.md
cp "$SRC/agents/skills/$skill/SKILL.md" "$DST/agents/skills/$skill/SKILL.md"
```

After syncing, verify with: `diff -r "$SRC/agents/skills/$skill/" "$DST/agents/skills/$skill/"`

## 19. Claude Skills Directory: Use Symlink, Not a Copy

In any skill registry repo, `claude/skills/` must be a symlink to `../agents/skills/`, not a separate directory with duplicated files. A real directory creates drift: skills get updated in one location but not the other.

```bash
# Correct setup
rm -rf claude/skills
ln -s ../agents/skills claude/skills

# Wrong: maintaining a separate real directory
cp -r agents/skills/ claude/skills/   # creates a copy that drifts
```

In the skills repository (`skills_repo_path` in `~/.ai-playbook/facts.md`), `claude/skills` must symlink to `../agents/skills`.

## 20. Skill and Doc Examples: Always Use Placeholder Values, Never Real Identifiers

When writing examples in skill files, documentation, or command specs, use generic placeholder values instead of real internal identifiers. Real identifiers (ticket numbers, account IDs, internal URLs) embedded in examples leak internal project state and require manual cleanup later.

- Jira tickets: use `PROJ-XXXXX` or `TEAM-XXXXX`, never a real ticket number
- AWS account IDs: use `<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>`, never a numeric account ID
- Internal Atlassian URLs: use `https://your-org.atlassian.net/...` as a template
- Internal IPs: use `<BROKER_IP>` or `192.0.2.x` (documentation range), never production/staging IPs

Apply this rule to the source repo as well; do not wait until the downstream sync to replace real identifiers.

This rule applies to negative examples too: do not illustrate what a real identifier looks like by showing one. The placeholder format is self-explanatory without a concrete bad example.

## 21. Configuration File Changes: Only When Explicitly Requested

Do not modify configuration files (`.gitignore`, `package.json`, `pom.xml`, CI configs, etc.) unless the user explicitly requests it. Inferring "this should also be gitignored" or "this dependency should be updated" from context and acting on it without prompting causes unexpected side-effects and makes changes harder to review.

When a configuration change seems necessary as a side-effect of another task, ask first rather than applying it silently.

## 22. PR Chain Awareness: Check Downstream Branches Before Flagging Missing Changes

When reviewing a PR in a stacked/chained PR series (multiple open PRs where each builds on the previous), a change that appears missing from the current PR may already be addressed in a downstream branch.

22.1. Before posting a review comment about missing tests, missing logic, or incomplete implementation, check whether the change exists in a later PR in the chain. If it does, the comment is unnecessary and creates noise.

22.2. To check: inspect open PRs targeting branches that are downstream of the current PR's head. If any downstream PR contains the referenced change, skip the comment entirely.

22.3. When a comment about a missing change has already been posted and the change is found downstream, remove the comment rather than leaving it open: open comments on stacked PRs that are addressed in a later PR mislead reviewers.

## 23. Rollback Ambiguity: Clarify Before Rolling Back a Pushed Commit

When asked to "rollback", "undo", or "revert" a pushed commit, clarify the intent before acting: the two approaches have different history implications:

- `git revert` (safe default): creates a new commit that undoes the change. Preserves history. Appropriate for shared branches where force-pushing is restricted.
- `git reset --hard <sha> && git push --force-with-lease` (clean history): removes the commit entirely. Appropriate when the user explicitly wants a clean history and force-pushing is acceptable.

23.1. If the user says "rollback" without specifying approach, ask: "Should I use `git revert` (adds a revert commit, preserves history) or `git reset --hard` + force push (removes the commit entirely)?"

23.2. Do not default to `git revert` when the user's intent is clearly to clean history. A revert of a recently pushed mistake adds unnecessary noise to the branch history.

## 24. Context Sharing Is Not an Action Directive

When a user shares context without an explicit action instruction (PR comments, review notes, error logs, issue descriptions, or similar), do not assume the task is to implement a fix or make changes.

24.1. Sharing context is a review/discussion act until the user explicitly says to implement, fix, apply, or create something. Ask about the intended working mode before acting.

24.2. Common ambiguous patterns:
- "We got this review comment: …": may mean "discuss it", "plan it", or "do it"; clarify.
- "The CI failed with: …": may mean "explain it", "investigate it", or "fix it"; clarify.
- "The PR has a finding about: …": may mean "is this valid?", "should we address it?", or "address it now"; clarify.

24.3. Ask once, concisely, not a multi-paragraph clarification. "Should I implement this or are we reviewing/discussing?" is enough.

## 25. Intent-Dependent Review Findings: Ask, Don't Prescribe

When a code review finding hinges on unstated design intent rather than clear incorrectness (for example, what a metric should count, what a state transition should allow, or what a timeout should cover), frame it as an open clarifying question instead of a directive correction.

25.1. Indicators that a finding is intent-dependent:
- The ticket says "add X" without specifying the semantics (e.g. "add metrics" without saying what to count).
- Both the current implementation and the suggested fix are reasonable depending on the goal.
- The artifact's own documentation (comment, name, description) hints at one interpretation but doesn't rule out the other.

25.2. Preferred framing: state the observation ("the metric fires after dispatch, so failures are not counted"), cite the documented intent ("the comment says 'entry point' which suggests counting all arrivals"), then ask ("should this metric count all attempts including failures, or only successful dispatches?"). Do not prescribe a fix when the answer depends on a design decision the author must make.

25.3. Before posting an intent-dependent finding, check the artifact's own description (metric comment, enum javadoc, constant name). If the description supports your interpretation, cite it. If the description is also ambiguous, say so explicitly in the question.

## 26. Read Telemetry Before Proposing Remediation

When diagnosing a system issue with metrics, logs, or dashboards available, read the actual evidence before proposing a remediation. Do not anchor on the first plausible hypothesis and present a fix as confirmed when the underlying data has not yet been inspected.

26.1. The failure mode this rule prevents: an early hypothesis (e.g. "pool too small, raise from 20 to 60") is written into a doc, ticket, or PR before any dashboard is opened. Later evidence flips the diagnosis (e.g. "pool is half-empty; the real cause is connection-creation latency"), forcing rewrites and undermining trust.

26.2. Discipline:
- Frame initial hypotheses explicitly as hypotheses, not as the diagnosis. Use phrasing like "candidate cause" or "to be confirmed".
- Before recommending a numeric change to a config value, surface the current metric reading for that value's effect (e.g. peak utilisation, max acquired, p99 latency).
- When the evidence flips a hypothesis, rewrite the artefact rather than appending a correction; future readers should not have to trace which version of the diagnosis is current.

26.3. Verify framework semantics before computing concurrency or capacity. A configuration knob's name often does not match its runtime effect (e.g. RocketMQ `consumeMessageBatchMaxSize` is the batch size delivered to the listener, not the parallelism; actual parallelism is `consumeThreadMax`). Read the listener implementation, not just the knob name, before arithmetic.

## 27. Separating Chronic Noise from Blocking Urgency

When a recurring error pattern is observed in production, separate "chronic background noise that retries catch" from "blocker that prevents the next change". Do not default to framing every error pattern as urgent or as a release blocker.

27.1. The failure mode this rule prevents: writing tickets that say "blocks safe rollout of X" when in fact X is unrelated and the existing retry/fallback path catches the failure. Overstating urgency wastes reviewer attention and creates artificial dependencies between unrelated work.

27.2. Tests to apply before claiming a fix is required for a downstream change:
- Does the failure pre-date the downstream change? If yes, the downstream change is not the cause.
- Does an existing retry/fallback mechanism catch the failure on first occurrence (RocketMQ `RECONSUME_LATER`, HTTP retry, idempotent re-publish)? If yes, the user-visible impact is limited to retries, not lost work.
- Does the downstream change increase the per-event resource footprint that drives the failure? If no, it does not amplify the issue.
- Is there a counter (e.g. permanently-dropped count, max-retries-exceeded count) that quantifies the user-visible impact? Use that, not the raw error rate, when arguing urgency.

27.3. When the above tests all pass, frame the work as "infra hygiene; fix opportunistically" rather than as a release blocker, and explicitly state that downstream changes are not blocked.

## 28. Do Not Add Unnecessary Coordination Steps

Do not add "confirm with team X" or "wait for approval from Y" acceptance criteria to tickets or PRs unless the change's effect actually requires that coordination. Adding coordination steps that the change does not warrant slows delivery without reducing risk.

28.1. The failure mode this rule prevents: a config or code change that does not alter peak resource usage, contract shape, or downstream-visible behaviour gets a "DBA must confirm capacity" or "SRE must approve" line. Reviewer and approver chains grow, but the underlying risk is unchanged.

28.2. Apply this test before adding a coordination step:
- Does the change move the peak load, peak resource count, or peak concurrency? If no, coordination based on peak capacity is not needed.
- Does the change alter an external contract (API, schema, message format)? If no, downstream consumer coordination is not needed.
- Does the change touch shared infrastructure that another team owns? If no, that team's approval is not needed.

28.3. If the change only shifts a baseline within previously-allowed peak (e.g. raising `min-idle` on a pool whose `max` is unchanged), the relevant capacity envelope is already approved; do not gate the change on re-approval.

## 29. Confirm Timezone Before Time-Correlating User-Shared Dashboards

When a user shares a dashboard screenshot, log excerpt, or timeline, confirm the timezone before correlating it to events with known timestamps (UTC stack traces, cron expressions, release windows). Local-time displays in Grafana, Kibana, and IDEs are common.

29.1. The failure mode this rule prevents: drawing a wrong correlation conclusion ("the screenshot doesn't show the incident window") because the dashboard is rendered in the user's local time but the incident timestamp is in UTC. The reverse error is also possible.

29.2. Discipline:
- When the user shares a screenshot whose time axis matters, ask once which timezone is displayed.
- When stating a correlation, include both representations explicitly (e.g. "08:11 UTC = 09:11 local CEST").
- When in doubt, prefer UTC for written analysis; convert to local only when addressing the user directly.

## 30. Verify Observability Artifact Inputs Before Authoring

When authoring a Grafana panel, Prometheus alert, or any observability artefact, verify that its inputs exist and have the expected shape before saving the artefact.

30.1. The failure mode this rule prevents: a new panel is added with a query against a metric that is not emitted, or a filter regex that does not match any label value (e.g. case mismatch). The panel renders empty in production and adds noise rather than signal.

30.2. Concrete checks:
- For a new metric query: confirm the metric appears in Prometheus today (`{__name__="<metric>"}` returns series) before adding the panel. If the metric requires app-side instrumentation that is not yet shipped, defer the panel and call out the instrumentation gap explicitly.
- For a regex filter against a label: read the actual label values in the running system. PromQL `=~` is case-sensitive; Micrometer often labels series with bean names (camelCase) rather than configured human-readable names. Test the regex against current label values before saving.
- When fixing an "empty panel" symptom, fix the underlying label/regex mismatch and document the actual label format inline in the dashboard's README so the next author does not repeat the mistake.

## 31. Verify Terminal State After Automation, Not Intermediate Confirmations

"Successfully triggered" is not "successfully applied". When invoking automation that spans multiple steps (UI button → API call → CI pipeline → git commit → reconciler sync → pod restart → config bind), verify the terminal observable state, not just the immediate response from the first step.

31.1. The failure mode this rule prevents: a tool returns HTTP 200 / `:white_check_mark: Successfully restarted` / similar success message at the API layer, but a downstream step (commit, deploy, restart, validation) silently no-ops or is reverted. The user-side experience looks fine while the actual state never changed. Subsequent debugging starts from a wrong premise ("we already restarted, so the issue must be elsewhere").

31.2. Discipline:
- Identify the terminal observable for the action: log content stops appearing, pod creation timestamp moves forward, metric value changes, file content updates.
- After the automation reports success, sample that observable before concluding the action took effect.
- If the user reports "it didn't work" after a successful trigger, treat the success message as advisory only and verify the terminal state from scratch.

## 32. GitOps Reconcilers Revert Imperative Changes

When a Kubernetes (or other declarative) resource is managed by a reconciler such as Argo CD, Flux, or similar (visible labels: `argocd.argoproj.io/instance`, `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm` paired with an ArgoCD Application, etc.), any imperative cluster mutation (`kubectl rollout restart`, `kubectl edit`, manual annotation) can be reverted on the next reconcile cycle. The reliable mechanism is to commit the change to the git source of truth so the reconciler propagates it.

32.1. The failure mode this rule prevents: a "restart didn't take" symptom is mistakenly attributed to the application (e.g. assumed startup failure) when in fact the reconciler scaled the new ReplicaSet down because the triggering annotation wasn't in git.

32.2. Diagnostic checks:
- Before troubleshooting a restart-that-didn't-restart, check the resource for reconciler-ownership labels.
- If the deployment is reconciler-managed, confirm the change reached git (commit log of the helm-values repo / kustomize overlay / etc.), not just the live cluster.
- Pod creation timestamps and reconciler "missing replicas" panels show the revert pattern: count briefly increases (new ReplicaSet started) then returns to baseline (reverted).

## 33. Follow the Project PR Template When Automation Depends on It

Many config-only repos gate CI behaviour on PR-template fields (a `[x]` checkbox in a "Restart Required?" section, machine-readable metadata `isRestartRequired: true`, region/service lists). Custom PR descriptions that bypass the template can silently disable that automation. When opening a PR against a repo with a configured template (`.github/pull_request_template.md` or visible default when the new-PR page loads), either use the template directly or, if a custom description is necessary for clarity, retain the template's machine-readable metadata block.

33.1. The failure mode this rule prevents: a custom PR description that reads well but omits `isRestartRequired: true`. The downstream pipeline silently sees the default (`false`) and skips the restart step. The PR merges, "nothing happens", and the discrepancy is invisible until someone notices the live state is stale.

33.2. Discipline:
- Before writing a custom PR description against an unfamiliar repo, read `.github/pull_request_template.md` (and any wiki/README about CI behaviour).
- Preserve template metadata blocks even when rewriting the human-readable sections.
- If the template's intent is unclear, search for the repo's wiki/runbook (see rule 34) for the pipeline that consumes those fields.

33.3. Squash-merge with a cleaned commit body is the second failure mode of the same rule. Many CI pipelines that read PR-template fields fetch them from the merge commit body, not from the PR body via API. When a user squash-merges and clears the body in the GitHub merge dialog, the metadata block disappears and the pipeline silently defaults to "no action". When opening a PR against a repo with PR-metadata-driven automation, warn the user explicitly at PR creation time AND if they signal they are about to merge: do not squash-merge with a cleaned commit message body. Either use a regular merge, or leave the body intact in the squash-merge dialog so the metadata survives.

## 34. Check Internal Runbooks Before Diagnosing Platform Tooling

When the user references an internal platform tool (autodeploy URL, custom Slack bot, deployment service, custom CI step), search for project-internal documentation (Confluence, repo wiki, README, runbook) describing its expected behaviour before running deep diagnostics or making assumptions. A 5-minute read of the runbook can settle questions that would otherwise take an hour of cluster probing or speculation.

34.1. The failure mode this rule prevents: developing an incorrect mental model of how an internal tool works ("the Slack bot must do `kubectl rollout restart` directly"), spending time gathering evidence to disprove it, and arriving at the same conclusion the runbook stated upfront.

34.2. Discipline:
- When the user names a tool, URL, or pipeline you have not seen documented, ask "is there a runbook / Confluence page / README for this?" before forming hypotheses.
- Read the page end-to-end, especially priority-order and default-value sections.
- When the runbook contradicts an earlier hypothesis, correct the hypothesis explicitly rather than quietly pivoting.

## 35. Do Not Raise Pure Formatting Nits In Design Review Threads

When drafting review feedback for a shared design doc, TDD, RFC, ticket, or Slack thread, do not raise purely cosmetic formatting issues unless the user explicitly asks for proofreading or polish.

35.1. The failure mode this rule prevents: review feedback includes a missing Markdown space, punctuation spacing, typo that does not affect comprehension, or similar low-value nit. This distracts from product, design, correctness, security, and implementation questions.

35.2. Apply this threshold before including a nit:
- If the issue changes meaning, creates ambiguity, breaks a code/config example, or could mislead implementers, include it.
- If the issue is only visual polish and the document remains understandable, omit it from the team-facing feedback.
- If tiny cleanups are useful to the user privately, mention them separately as optional polish, not as review comments to send to the team.

## 36. Commit Messages Must Describe Only Implemented Changes

A commit message must describe what the code actually does, not what a plan document says will be done in the future. When a squash merge includes an updated plan file alongside implemented changes, the commit message should describe only the implemented changes. A plan file being updated is a documentation change, not an implementation of the planned features.

36.1. Before writing the commit message for a squash merge, distinguish: which changes are working code/tests, and which are plan documents that describe future work. Only reference the working code in the message body.

## 37. Verify Branch Scope Before Committing PR Review Fixes

When implementing fixes for PR review comments, every change must belong to the scope of the PR's branch before it is committed there.

37.1. Before staging any file change, ask: "Does this file belong to this branch?" If a file lives in a folder that should go to a different branch (e.g., `individual/<name>/` while on a team feature branch), commit it to the correct branch separately instead.

37.2. The failure mode this rule prevents: a PR review batch includes comments on both `individual/` files and `department/` files. Committing all fixes together pollutes the PR with out-of-scope files, breaks branch isolation, and forces a soft-reset to untangle them.

37.3. In multi-scope repositories, establish which folders belong to which branches before starting a review fix session. Only then classify each review comment by branch scope.

37.4. **PR thread replies are for the reviewer.** Do not put questions or decision prompts for your human partner in a GitHub review reply (for example "say if you want this cherry-picked onto …"). State the technical answer for the reviewer; keep partner-only options and follow-ups in the chat session.

37.5. **PR thread replies state current behavior and current scope.** A reply implies a planned follow-up only when an authoritative project source records that plan; do not use roadmap language ("future", "planned", "will be added") on speculation. Name contract mechanisms by the repository's own term (for example, keep durable replay safety distinct from `Idempotency-Key` header semantics). The `receiving-review` skill's roadmap and terminology gates are the operational enforcement of this rule and point here rather than restating it.

## 38. Verify a Skill's Default Behavior Before Writing About It

Before writing any documentation, PR description, or explanation that describes what a skill or tool does by default, read the skill's `SKILL.md` (or the tool's README) to confirm the default output mode, trigger conditions, and opt-in flags.

38.1. Do not infer default behavior from memory, the skill's name, or partial context. Default behavior that diverges from expectations is usually the intentional design (e.g., "write locally first, post to PR only on explicit opt-in").

38.2. If no canonical source is readily available, note uncertainty inline rather than stating the behavior as fact.

## 39. Output Writing Style: No Em Dashes, Prefer Globish

When generating any text artifact (PR descriptions, READMEs, skill docs, commit messages, comments):

39.1. Do not use em dashes (U+2014). Use a colon, a comma, a semicolon, a period, or rewrite the sentence. This applies to Jira issue descriptions and comments, Confluence pages, and any other content sent through MCP tools, not only files on disk.

39.2. Use plain, direct English (globish): short sentences, common words, active voice. Avoid complex punctuation or literary constructions. For vocabulary replacements and `## Terms` rules, see §45.

39.3. **Self-check before saving or sending.** Before writing a ticket/page/PR body or committing, scan the composed text for U+2014 and replace every occurrence. Treat this as a mandatory step when a skill composes an artifact (for example `jira-workflow`, `slack-message`, Confluence MCP updates).

39.4. **Mechanical enforcement (agent-agnostic).** Policy compliance does not depend on a specific IDE or agent runtime. Use these layers in order:

| Layer | Mechanism | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compose | §39.3 self-check + skill scan steps | Before save/send |
| Pre-commit | `check-no-em-dash.sh` (`staged` or `touched`) | Before `git commit` |
| Session end | `done` skill Step 2.76 | Before staging prose files |
| CI / guardrail | Repo test or lint on agreed doc roots | On `mvn test` / PR |

Portable script (default path): `~/.ai-playbook/scripts/check-no-em-dash.sh` (override via `CHECK_NO_EM_DASH_SCRIPT` in facts when keyed). Scans `*.md`, `*.mdc`, and instruction entrypoint filenames unless `CHECK_NO_EM_DASH_ALL=1`.

39.5. **Optional agent-runtime hooks.** User-installed hooks (for example Cursor `preToolUse` on Slack/Atlassian MCP and prose file edits) add a second line of defense. They are **not** canonical policy storage and are not required for other agents to comply.

39.6. **Product repos vs agent tooling.** Em-dash policy and enforcement belong in the **agent layer** (this section, `done` Step 2.76, `check-no-em-dash.sh` under the user playbook scripts). Do **not** add to a product/service repository: one-off fix scripts, guardrail tests, or numbered project-guidelines rules whose sole purpose is agent prose style. Cleaning em dashes in committed docs is fine; mechanical gates stay outside the product codebase unless the team explicitly adopts a human style guide for that repo.

## 40. Named Tools and Skills Must Be Visually Listed, Not Only Inline

When writing documentation that describes a workflow involving named tools, skills, or components, make those names discoverable by listing them explicitly at the end of each section, not only embedded in prose sentences.

40.1. Use a labeled list (`Skills:`, `Tools:`, `Components:`) as the last item in each workflow section. Monospace inline mentions alone are not sufficient: they scatter names across sentences and make the tool inventory hard to scan.

40.2. The prose explains behaviour; the list names what to invoke. Both are required.

40.3. When the skill set covers multiple review modes (e.g. code review and design-document review), include a separate section for each mode with its own labeled skill list. Do not merge them into one block.

## 41. Markdown Tables: Escape Pipes in Cell Values

When a Markdown table cell contains a literal `|` (for example Grafana panel titles with dimension separators):

41.1. Escape pipes as `\|` inside the cell, or switch to a numbered/bulleted list when values are long or pipe-heavy.

41.2. Unescaped `|` breaks column alignment; the row renders as extra columns or truncated content.

## 42. User AGENTS Entrypoints vs Repository Paths

When documenting setup for Codex, Claude, or Copilot user instructions:

42.1. Agents load `<instructions_repo>/docs/AGENTS.md` through `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, an `@` import in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`, or Cursor `global-user-instructions.mdc`, not by opening the repo path during a session.

42.2. Put entrypoint verification commands (symlink checks, `test -f` on `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`) in `docs/AGENTS.md`. Keep runtime folder mapping and symlink recipes in `agent-runtime-layout.md` under `shared_docs_dir` (directory symlink to `instructions_repo/projects/.ai-playbook/`).

42.3. Keep user identity and machine paths in `~/.ai-playbook/facts.md` only. Do not place `facts.md` under `shared_docs_dir`; that directory is for shared, committable guidelines.

## 43. Shared Guidelines Repo Path Mirrors Runtime `.ai-playbook`

Cross-project coding and workflow guidelines belong in version control at `instructions_repo/projects/.ai-playbook/`, matching the runtime directory name under `~/Projects/.ai-playbook/`.

43.1. Do not use a different repo folder name (for example `docs/projects/`) when runtime `shared_docs_dir` is already `~/Projects/.ai-playbook/`.

43.2. Wire runtime with one directory symlink: `ln -sfn "<instructions_repo>/projects/.ai-playbook" ~/Projects/.ai-playbook` (see `agent-runtime-layout.md`).

## 44. Public Repository Push Hygiene

Before pushing to a public repository (especially vendored skills), verify both file content and commit history in the push range.

44.1. Never force-push without explicit user approval, even when correcting a mistaken push.

44.2. When asked to squash before push, squash only unpushed commits (`origin/<branch>..HEAD` via `git reset --soft origin/<branch>`). Do not rewrite the full repository history unless the user explicitly asks.

44.3. Audit commit subjects and bodies in the push range for `Co-authored-by:` trailers and employer or client brand names. Scan vendored skill files for the same patterns. Copyright lines in `LICENSE.txt` are exempt.

## 45. Plain Language for Human-Facing Artifacts

Applies to plans, RFCs, PR descriptions, BFF/API docs, Confluence pages, Slack drafts, and any other text meant for humans to read (not code comments or internal transport-layer notes).

45.1. **Default vocabulary:** use common English when it carries the same meaning as insider jargon. Short sentences, active voice. Write for a typical backend peer, not only for readers who already know the team's metaphors. Complements §39 (globish); §45 adds actionable replacements and glossary rules. Concision does not exempt undefined jargon: if a niche term stays because it is shorter, put it in `## Terms` / `# Terminology` (or spell it out on first use per 45.5).

45.2. **Prefer plain terms in human-facing docs** (use the right column unless the audience is transport/OpenAPI code). Examples in this table use generic placeholders per §20, not real endpoints, fields, or domain nouns from one project.

| Avoid in plans, RFCs, PRs | Prefer |
|---|---|
| wire contract / wire format | **API contract**, **public API response shape**, **JSON request/response** |
| wire names / wire enums | **JSON field names**, **API enum values** |
| snapshot (alone) | **read result**, **GET response payload**, or name the endpoint |
| gate term (alone) | name the endpoint (e.g. `POST /v1/<resource>-checks`) or **validation API** |
| transport layer | **HTTP/API layer** (e.g. `app` module) |
| orchestration shell | **coordinates steps**; name what it calls |
| normalization-aware | **compare values after formatting them the same way** |
| enum-sourced message | **error text from a fixed enum**, not exception text |
| partial-empty | describe literally (e.g. `items: []`, `isHidden: true`) |
| INNER JOIN gap | **database join misses rows** when stored values do not match exactly |
| RED / GREEN (in Gist only) | OK in plan **tasks**; in Gist use **failing test first**, **make test pass** |
| gated off (the default test run / CI) | **not run in normal `mvn test`**, **only when someone runs them on purpose** |
| self-contained (integration tests) | **start their own dependency in the test** (for example Testcontainers), **no manual setup** |
| eagle view / eagle's view | **high-level overview**, **bird's-eye view** (calendar titles, Slack, Confluence) |
| ingress / egress (API metaphor) | **request path that accepts …**, **response that returns …** (or define in Terms if kept) |
| blast radius | **compromise scope**, **impact of one leaked key** |

45.3. **Code vs docs split:** "wire format" and similar transport vocabulary are fine in `project-guidelines.md`, OpenAPI descriptions, and Java transport comments where the team already uses them. Do not use them in plan **Gist & Examples**, PR summaries, or BFF docs when a plain equivalent exists.

45.4. **`## Terms` section (required when needed):** add immediately after the document title (before the main body) when the doc uses **three or more** project-specific terms, acronyms, or jargon that a new reader might not know. Format:

```markdown
## Terms
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| ... | One-line plain English |
```

45.5. **First-use rule:** when a niche term must appear and a `## Terms` section is not warranted (one or two terms only), spell it out on first use: **"user read result (`GET /v1/users/{userId}`)"**.

45.6. **Shared dictionary:** recurring workspace terms belong in the ownership `dictionary.md` (company or personal-projects `.ai-playbook/`) or repo `docs/glossary.md` when present. Document-level `## Terms` tables are for one-off context; do not duplicate long glossary entries inline.

45.7. **Skill and instruction hooks:** writing-heavy skills (`plans`, `github-pr-workflow`, `rfc-design`, `review-confluence-doc`, `slack-message`) must reference this section. When `learn` captures a wording correction, add the replacement to the table in 45.2 (if universal) or the relevant `dictionary.md` / `docs/glossary.md`.

45.8. **Document results, not deliberation.** In long-lived artifacts (canonical docs, high-level task docs, issue trackers) record the decision and its current-state outcome, not the reasoning path that produced it (why alternatives were rejected, what was extracted/renamed/split from where, phrases like "former Slice 2", or transient caveats like "not exercised yet in the current state"). Keep rationale and alternatives in the single designated decisions/ADR doc; everywhere else state only the result. In an issue/ticket description, describe only that ticket's own scope; do not narrate adjacent or follow-up tickets, extraction history, or prioritization reasoning. State the split/mapping as a plain pointer when needed, not as a justification.

45.9. **Do not overload product-phase labels in meeting or calendar titles.** When a phase name already labels the product or program (for example the new CRM is already called "MVP"), do not reuse that same word as a shorthand for a technical topic ("MVP delivery", "MVP notifications"). Prefer the concrete subject: ownership, Legacy CRM reuse, PII, service boundaries. Phase words stay for scope or timeline only when the meeting is actually about the phase gate itself.

## 46. Maintain Workflow Invariants Until Explicitly Paused

When a workflow (plan review, TDD cycle, PR process) has an explicit exit condition
(e.g., "Repeat until Blockers=0 AND Medium=0"), the agent must:

46.1. Track whether the exit condition is met. Maintain this invariant as active
until it is satisfied.

46.2. NOT stop when only a formatting/content constraint is given (e.g., "TEXT ONLY",
"no tool calls", "respond in plain text"). Such constraints are output format
requirements, not pause signals.

46.3. Clarify with the user whether they want to continue or pause the workflow
when uncertain. State the workflow's current state and next step explicitly.

46.4. To pause, the user must say "pause", "stop", or give an equivalent explicit
instruction. A format constraint alone does not override a workflow's exit condition.

46.5. When uncertain: acknowledge the constraint, state the workflow invariant and
next step, and ask whether to proceed.

**Examples of correctly handling format constraints vs pause requests:**

| User says | Workflow state | Correct response |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| "TEXT ONLY" | Review Round 2 has Medium=2, exit condition requires Medium=0 | Acknowledge, state "Round 2 has Medium=2, must continue to Round 3. Proceed with fixes?" |
| "pause" | Any state | Stop workflow, await explicit continuation signal |
| "no tool calls" | Review Round 2 has Medium=2 | Provide text summary of fixes needed, ask whether to apply them |

**Why this matters:** Multi-step workflows like plan review have quality gates
that must be satisfied. Stopping early due to a misinterpreted format constraint
produces incomplete output that fails downstream quality checks.

## 47. Shared Skill References in Generic Instructions

47.1. **Runtime edit path:** `~/.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`. When `~/.claude/skills` is symlinked to `~/.agents/skills`, both resolve to one tree; edit once; do not maintain duplicate sync rules.

47.2. **Commit/mirror target:** resolve the skills repository from `skills_repo_path` in `~/.ai-playbook/facts.md`, or deduce via `readlink -f ~/.agents/skills`. Do not hardcode local clone names or paths in generic skills or cross-project instruction files.

47.3. **Project repo instruction files:** defer shared skill maintenance with a one-liner (for example: follow self-maintenance rules in `~/.agents/skills/learn/SKILL.md`). Do not restate multi-path sync recipes or vendor-specific command copies.

47.4. **Migrated skills:** workflows moved to the shared registry (for example `learn`) are skill-only. Remove stale `.opencode/command/<skill>.md` references and local command copies when encountered.

47.5. **Contract coherence across related artifacts:** when a primary instruction or code artifact renames a dependency, changes path-resolution contract text, or updates summary bullets that mirror a canonical script, verify every supporting artifact that implements or echoes that contract stays aligned (linked docs, companion files, scripts invoked by name). Primary-artifact correctness alone is not enough if dependents still instruct the old workflow. During implementation-plan review, the explicit file list is a floor, not a ceiling: use the two-tier Review Scope model in the `plans` skill (explicit must-fix plus plan-related extension).

47.6. **Executable vs reference documentation:** when validation or review checks wiring documented in prose, exercise the canonical executable artifact (named script, monolithic bash block, runtime config), not an illustrative snippet elsewhere. Mark address-review findings `done` only when the executable artifact is fixed.

## 48. Public Skill Examples and Local Hygiene Scans

48.1. **Neutral placeholders only** in committed skill and instruction files: use fictitious ticket keys (`PROJ-1234`), domains (`your-org.atlassian.net`), and feature slugs (`feature-name`). Never real Jira numbers, employer ticket prefixes, org domains, GitHub handles, or session-specific identifiers, even in "example" prose.

48.2. **Deny patterns stay local:** machine-specific hygiene regexes belong in `public_hygiene_patterns_file` (user facts), not in the public repo. The repo may ship an empty template (`docs/scan-public-hygiene.patterns.example`) only.

48.3. **Runner source vs runtime:** repo-root `scripts/` is the TRACKED canonical home for shared agent scripts (hygiene runners like `scan-public-hygiene.sh`, `check-no-em-dash.sh`, `check-instruction-size.sh`, `done-lock.sh`, plus the lessons gate/adopter/migrator). Runtime copies under `~/.ai-playbook/scripts/` are synced from this tracked source. Execute `public_hygiene_scan_script` from user facts (typically under `~/.ai-playbook/scripts/`). Only machine-specific or secrets-bearing scripts (e.g. `sync-mcp-credentials.sh`) and `public_hygiene_patterns_file` stay local and gitignored under `~/.ai-playbook/scripts/`.

48.4. **Before skill commits:** run the hygiene scan; personal contact email is allowed only in `LICENSE.txt` copyright lines.

48.5. **Done lock agent wait:** Agent `/done` Step 0 must call `wait-acquire --max-wait "${DONE_LOCK_AGENT_MAX_WAIT_SECS:-90}"`, not the script default 7200s. On timeout, return `blocked` with `done-lock.sh status` (holder `label`, `holder_pid`, `holder_alive`). `done-lock.sh` records `holder_pid` at acquire; auto-steal only when abandoned (dead PID and no matching session fence) or stale without a session fence. Session-fenced locks are never auto-stolen; operator `stale-clean` may remove a fenced lock that is also stale. Step 6 must release with `DONE_LOCK_DIR` and `DONE_LOCK_TOKEN` from this chat's Step 0 acquire exports (`release` or `release-repo`); both refuse to load the shared `<repo>/.ai-playbook/done-lock.session` file (fence/status only; avoids confused-deputy after peer acquire). Re-export those two values from Step 0 stdout across Shell tool calls. Step 7 must always report outcome (commits or clean tree, lock free); never stop after Step 0 checks only.

48.6. **Portable skills stay system-agnostic:** when promoting a product-incident fix into a shared skill, encode the verification rule (for example "every diagram hop must be traceable to architecture inputs"), never one product's topology as universal truth. Product-specific routing, service names, and edge placement belong in that product's RFC or Layer 2 docs, not in `agents/skills/`.

## 49. Verify an Implement Sub-Agent's "Already Done" Claim Against Actual Git State

When an implement sub-agent reports that work for the current task "was already done in a preceding task" (or any similar claim that the task's deliverables predate this run), the orchestrator must verify the claim against actual git state before treating the task as complete and launching `done`.

49.1. **Run `git status` and `git diff --stat` before Step 1.4.** The task's `Files:` list should show up as modified or staged. If `git status` shows no changes for the task's files, the "already done" claim is false: either the preceding task did not actually land the work, or the work exists only in the sub-agent's narrative.

49.2. **Cross-check the implement log against `git log`.** If the sub-agent's log says "no changes in Task N beyond verification" but `git log --oneline -5` shows no commit touching the task's files since the preceding task's `done`, the work was never committed and the task is incomplete.

49.3. **Do not launch `done` on a task with an empty diff for its `Files:` list** unless the sub-agent provides an explicit, justified reason (for example: a refactor moved the work into a different file, with a diff showing the move). An empty diff with a narrative "already done" explanation is the failure mode this rule prevents.

49.4. **Why this matters:** Implement sub-agents sometimes infer state from the plan or from a sibling task's log rather than from the repository. An "already wired" or "already implemented" claim that is not backed by a real diff causes the orchestrator to skip verification, launch `done` on an empty change set, and either commit nothing or commit unrelated pre-existing changes, leaving the task's actual deliverable unimplemented while the manifest reports success.

49.5. **Recovery:** if verification reveals the claim is false, re-launch the implement sub-agent with the corrected state context ("the diff for your `Files:` list is empty; the preceding task did not land this work"). Do not silently proceed to the next task.

**Anti-pattern:** An implement sub-agent reports "the single-line call to `apply_dedup()` was already wired at `crypto_reporting.py:205-210` during Task 5; no changes in Task 6 beyond verification." The orchestrator trusts this narrative and launches `done`. But `git status` shows `crypto_reporting.py` and `derivatives_dedup.py` as modified; the wiring is in Task 6's uncommitted diff, not in Task 5's commit. The narrative confused "this is where the call lives" with "this was committed by a preceding task." Without the git-state check, `done` would commit Task 6's work under a misleading "already done" framing, and the manifest row for Task 6 would understate what the task delivered.

## 50. Facts vs Skill Configuration: Do Not Duplicate Policy in Facts

50.1. **Facts hold environment, not workflow policy.** `user_facts_path`, ownership facts, and repo `repo_facts_rel` store machine paths, accounts, domains, repo path keys, and local-only hygiene artifacts. They do **not** store portable numeric thresholds, loop limits, or skill completion criteria.

50.2. **Skills own portable policy.** Byte budgets, retry counts, gate mode names, placement ladders, and "when to run" rules belong in the owning skill's `SKILL.md` (for example instruction size budget in `learn` Step 6.5 and `done` Step 2.8).

50.3. **Scripts follow the same split.** Default behavior and constants live in the skill and in shared scripts tracked under repo-root `scripts/` (canonical source), synced to `~/.ai-playbook/scripts/` at runtime. Facts may point at a runtime script path when it varies by machine; facts must not restate the script's policy constants. Only secrets-bearing or machine-specific scripts (e.g. `sync-mcp-credentials.sh`, `public_hygiene_patterns_file`) remain gitignored under `~/.ai-playbook/scripts/`.

50.3.1. **Ephemeral throwaway scripts vs `{tmp_dir}` documents.** `{tmp_dir}` (default `docs/tmp/`) is for **documents** only: execute-plan session logs (`.md`), review scratch (`.md`), diff snapshots (`.patch`) - these have reference value for the next round's `learn` step and are synced to the orphan `docs` branch as a safety net. Throwaway **scripts and scratch data** (`.py` shadow/verification scripts, `.csv`/`.txt` baseline counts, `__pycache__/`) go in repo-root `tmp/`, never `{tmp_dir}`. Root `tmp/` is gitignored and NOT synced to the `docs` branch; throwaway scripts have zero durable value and pollute the safety net when they land in `docs/tmp/`. This fills the gap between §50.3's canonical `scripts/` (committed, shared) and runtime `~/.ai-playbook/scripts/` (gitignored, secrets-bearing): a third category that is ephemeral, project-local, and never backed up.

50.3.2. **Never dump `git diff` / review captures at the repository root.** No patch, diff, or capture file of any name belongs next to `pom.xml` / `.git` or in any tracked path; examples of names this catches: `diff_r*.patch`, `src_diff_r*.patch`, `*diff-capture*` (e.g. `.crm*-diff-capture.txt`). This is the canonical home of the rule; skill docs (`doing-code-review`, `review-agents`) point here rather than re-derive it. On stdout truncation, prefer the runtime's saved capture for the command (e.g. Cursor `agent-tools/*.txt`) when one exists; otherwise materialize review/diff patches under `{tmp_dir}/code-review/<session-slug>/`. Throwaway non-review scripts/data still follow §50.3.1 (root `tmp/`); review/diff captures do not, they belong under `{tmp_dir}/code-review/`, never at the repo root. Orchestrators that launch a sub-agent whose job is "return full `git diff` output" must put this rule in that sub-agent's prompt with `{tmp_dir}` resolved to an absolute path. See `doing-code-review` **Diff access**.

50.4. **User correction trigger:** When the user says a constant "can live in the skill" or "doesn't need to be in facts", remove the facts key; do not rename it to another facts entry. Update the owning skill instead.

50.5. **Cross-reference:** `learn` Step 2: Facts vs skill configuration; Step 3 qualification gate check #2.

## 53. MCP OAuth Credentials: Paths in Facts, Tokens in credentials/

53.1. **Never store access or refresh tokens in `user_facts_path`, repo `repo_facts_rel`, committed docs, Jira, or Slack.** Facts may list **paths and workflow keys** (`mcp_credentials_dir`, `mcp_cursor_auth_backup`, `mcp_credentials_sync_script`).

53.2. **Backup location:** `~/.ai-playbook/credentials/` (mode `700`; JSON files mode `600`). Separate Cursor MCP backup (`mcp-cursor.json`) from `mcp-remote` CLI backup (`mcp-atlassian-mcp-remote/`).

53.3. **Workflow:** After user OAuth in Cursor, run `sync-mcp-credentials.sh snapshot`. When a session reports missing Slack/Atlassian MCP auth, run `restore`. Use `status` to verify without printing secrets.

53.4. **Live vs backup:** Cursor canonical auth is `~/.cursor/projects/Users-andrey/mcp-auth.json` (adjust user segment per machine). Per-project `mcp-auth.json` may lag; `restore` can refresh both user-level and `CURSOR_PROJECT_DIR` project files.

53.5. **Cross-reference:** `user_facts_path` §MCP OAuth; `learn` Step 2: Facts vs skill configuration.

53.6. **Atlassian: one auth path per task.** IDE MCP integration, CLI agent MCP integration, standalone MCP proxy, and REST bearer token stores are **separate**. Do not chain them in one task. If the active integration is already authenticated, use it only; do not start an alternate proxy, re-run login, or delete local OAuth token files. At most **one** browser OAuth prompt per task; re-prompt only when the chosen path fails with an explicit auth error.

53.7. **`restore` vs fresh login:** Never run a credential **restore** immediately after a successful OAuth login in the same task; it can overwrite fresh tokens with an old backup. After login: **snapshot**. Use restore only in a later session when auth is missing. Repo Confluence scripts (`scripts/sync-confluence.py`) must use the same authenticated MCP path as the active agent integration, not an untested alternate REST bearer store. Runtime-specific commands and local enforcement hooks live in `user_facts_path` §MCP OAuth (not in committed repo docs).

## 51. Instruction Context Loading: Always-On vs On Demand

51.1. **Always-on entrypoints:** user-level `AGENTS.md`, repo `AGENTS.md`, applicable `facts.md`, and the triggered skill body for the current workflow. These fit a fixed byte budget (see `learn` Step 6.5 / `done` Step 2.8).

51.2. **On demand:** canonical guideline tiers (`project_guidelines_rel`, `company_guidelines_master`, files under `shared_docs_dir`, Layer 2 repo docs). Open only the **section or numbered rule** the task touches, not whole files every turn.

51.3. **Compaction placement:** full rule text lives in the canonical tier; instruction entrypoints keep repo deltas, hard constraints, and one-line pointers. Compacting entrypoints without moving text to canonical tiers recreates context overload elsewhere.

51.4. **Anti-pattern:** replacing hybrid bullets in `AGENTS.md` with pointers while still bulk-loading entire `project-guidelines.md` or company master at task start; the win is smaller always-on context **and** selective canonical reads.

## 52. Bulk Find-Replace Verification: Re-Inventory After the Pass

After any bulk text replacement across git history (e.g., `git filter-repo --replace-text`, `git filter-branch`, sed-based rewrites), re-run the **same** inventory query you ran before the scrub. A single-character typo in the replacements file (a transposed digit in a token, a missing brace in a regex) silently leaves real data in history while looking successful.

**Verification procedure:**

1. Capture the pre-scrub inventory output (list of files/lines matching sensitive patterns).
2. Run the scrub.
3. Run the inventory query again across **all** history (`git log --all -p | grep ...`), not just HEAD.
4. If any real pattern remains, identify the typo, add a corrected entry to the replacements file, and re-run the scrub with `--force`.

**Why this matters:** `git filter-repo --replace-text` reports success as long as it parses commits, regardless of whether every pattern you intended actually matched. The only signal that catches a typo is re-running the inventory and seeing zero hits.

## 53. filter-repo Rewrites All Refs: Use External Pristine Backup

`git filter-repo` operates on the entire repository: every branch, every tag, every ref. Backup branches and tags created **inside** the same repo before running filter-repo get rewritten along with everything else, so they are useless as pristine recovery points.

**Procedure:**

1. Before running filter-repo, copy the entire repo directory (or at least `.git/`) to an external location: `cp -r <repo> <repo>.pre-scrub.bak`.
2. Run filter-repo on the working repo.
3. If recovery is needed, restore from the external copy. In-repo branches like `pre-scrub-backup` were also rewritten and will not help.
4. Note: filter-repo also strips the `origin` remote by default. Re-add it with `git remote add origin <url>` before pushing.

## 54. Glob Discovery for Test Fixtures with Sensitive Identifiers

When end-to-end or integration tests load real-data fixtures whose filenames embed sensitive identifiers (Koinly account tokens, customer IDs, session tokens), hardcoding those identifiers in test constants leaks the identifier into tracked test code. The fixture files themselves may be gitignored, but the test file referencing them by exact name is committed.

**Pattern:** Discover fixtures by glob, not by hardcoded token.

```python
# Bad: embeds the real fixture token into test code
_CG_FILENAME = "koinly_2025_capital_gains_report_<REAL_ACCOUNT_TOKEN>.csv"

# Good: token never appears in tracked code
def _cg_path() -> Path:
    matches = sorted(_FIXTURE_DIR.glob("koinly_2025_capital_gains_report_*.csv"))
    if not matches:
        pytest.skip("capital gains fixture not available")
    return matches[0]
```

**Why this matters:** Test code is published with the repo; fixture CSVs usually are not. Hardcoded identifiers in test constants survive every git operation and can only be retracted by history rewrite. Glob discovery eliminates the leak surface entirely and is robust to fixture renaming (any token matches the pattern).

## 55. Non-Destructive Baseline Comparisons: Never `git stash` to Run a Tool on a Clean Tree

When you need to compare a tool's output (linter, formatter, test runner, build) between the current working tree and a known baseline (HEAD, a base branch, a clean state), do NOT achieve a "clean" tree by stashing the working changes, running the tool, then popping the stash. `git stash` mutates both the index and the working tree as a side effect, and in unusual index states (staged deletions, partial staging, untracked files, or trees touched by a docs/orphan-branch workflow) the stash or its pop can silently drop files from the working tree. Recovery from a dropped stash is possible (`git fsck --lost-found` then restore from the dangling commit/blob) but is exactly the kind of avoidable, time-consuming incident this rule prevents.

**Non-destructive alternatives (use these instead):**
1. **Pipe the committed blob straight into the tool** (no working-tree mutation):
   ```bash
   git show HEAD:<path> | <linter> -        # e.g. ruff check - , flake8 - , eslint --stdin
   git show <base>:<path> | <linter> -
   ```
2. **Inspect the diff only** (`git diff [<base>] -- <path>`) and reason about the hunks; many baseline questions are answerable from the diff without running the tool on a clean tree.
3. **Use an isolated worktree** when you genuinely must run the tool on a fully clean checkout:
   ```bash
   git worktree add <tmp-path> <base>        # isolated; remove with: git worktree remove <tmp-path>
   ```
   A worktree is a separate working tree and never touches your in-progress index.

**Qualification gate (when this rule applies):**
- You are about to type `git stash` solely to get a clean tree to run a tool against, intending `git stash pop` afterward.
- The repo has any unusual index state (staged deletions, partial adds, gitignored artifacts overlapping tracked paths, an active docs/orphan-branch workflow).

**Anti-pattern:** `git stash && <tool> <baseline> && git stash pop` to compare linter output before/after edits. When the working tree carries staged deletions (files marked deleted in the index but still present on disk), the stash records the deletion and the pop may not restore the on-disk content, leaving tracked files missing.

**General form:** Never use a state-mutating operation (`stash`, `reset --hard`, `checkout -- .`) as a transient scratchpad for a comparison that a non-mutating read (`git show`, `git diff`, `git worktree`) can answer. The destructive command's failure modes depend on index state you may not have audited; the read-only command has none.

**Shell portability note (zsh):** When scripting a git command that takes multiple paths stored in a variable (e.g., restoring several files from a commit), do not pass an unquoted space-separated string. zsh does NOT word-split unquoted variables by default (unlike bash), so `git checkout <sha> -- $FILES` treats the whole string as one pathspec and fails ("pathspec did not match"). Use a quoted array expansion, which works in both shells:
```bash
files=(path/a.py path/b.py path/c.py)
git checkout <sha> -- "${files[@]}"
```
This matters most during recovery scripts (restore N files from a dangling commit) where a silent failure leaves the tree half-restored.

## 56. Instruction Cross-References Are Load-Bearing: Read the Referenced Section Before Acting

Always-loaded instruction files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md) summarize rules and often end a bullet with a cross-reference for the procedure or detail: "see <doc> #N", "see coding_guidelines.md #4", "see agent_workflow_guidelines.md #39". The cross-reference is part of the rule, not a footnote. Open the referenced section before acting.

**Rule:** before implementing any instruction whose bullet carries a "see <doc> #N" pointer, open that section and follow the procedure there. The summary line is a pointer; the referenced section holds the enforceable detail.

**Anti-pattern:** reading only the summary ("never use em dashes"), stopping, and substituting your own procedure for the documented one. The em-dash rule points to section 39; section 39.1 specifies the replacement (a colon, comma, semicolon, period, or sentence rewrite), not a hyphen. Treating "no em dashes" as "replace with a hyphen" ignored the referenced procedure and produced output that still violated the rule.

**General form:** a one-line rule plus a cross-reference is a two-part instruction. Acting on part one without reading part two is acting on an incomplete instruction. Substituting your own assumption for the referenced procedure is the same hazard as introducing a hardcoded value without flagging it or asking the user.

**Why this matters:** the cross-reference exists precisely because the full procedure does not fit the always-loaded entrypoint budget (section 51). Skipping it replaces a reviewed, documented procedure with an ad-hoc guess that looks compliant at a glance but is not. When the referenced section is genuinely ambiguous on how to satisfy the rule, ask the user instead of guessing.

## 57. Agent Coding Discipline: Think, Simplify, Stay Surgical, Verify

Behavioral rules to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Biases toward caution over speed; for trivial tasks, use judgment. Pattern adapted from public agent coding-discipline corpora.

### 57.1 Think before implementing

57.1.1. State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.

57.1.2. If multiple interpretations exist, present them. Do not pick silently.

57.1.3. If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.

57.1.4. If something is unclear, stop. Name what is confusing. Ask.

### 57.2 Simplicity first

57.2.1. Write the minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

57.2.2. No features, abstractions, flexibility, or configurability beyond what was asked.

57.2.3. No error handling for impossible scenarios.

57.2.4. If the solution is much longer than necessary, rewrite it simpler.

57.2.5. Ask: would a senior engineer call this overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

### 57.3 Surgical changes

57.3.1. Touch only what the task requires. See also section 8 (scope discipline).

57.3.2. Do not "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting. Do not refactor what is not broken.

57.3.3. Match existing style, even if you would do it differently.

57.3.4. If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it. Do not delete it unless asked.

57.3.5. Remove imports, variables, and functions that **your** changes made unused. Do not remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

57.3.6. Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 57.4 Goal-driven execution

57.4.1. Transform tasks into verifiable success criteria before coding.

57.4.2. Examples: "Add validation" → write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass; "Fix the bug" → write a repro test, then make it pass; "Refactor X" → ensure tests pass before and after.

57.4.3. For multi-step work, state a brief plan with a verify check per step (for example: `1. [step] → verify: [check]`).

57.4.4. Strong success criteria allow independent verification loops. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**Working if:** fewer unnecessary diff lines, fewer rewrites from overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## 58. Gemini CLI and Antigravity: Skill Registry Wiring

When wiring Google Gemini CLI or Antigravity to the shared skill registry:

58.1. **Canonical edit path:** `~/.agents/skills` (symlink to `instructions_repo/agents/skills`). Edit skills there once.

58.2. **Vendor discovery paths differ:** Gemini CLI scans `~/.agents/skills/` natively; do not add a redundant `~/.gemini/skills` symlink. Antigravity global skills use `~/.gemini/config/skills/` ([official docs](https://antigravity.google/docs/skills)); Antigravity does not scan `~/.agents/skills/` on its own.

58.3. **Whole-directory symlink for Antigravity:** wire `~/.gemini/config/skills` with one directory symlink to `~/.agents/skills`. Do **not** populate vendor folders with per-skill symlinks inside; Antigravity silently ignores those ([vercel-labs/skills#633](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills/issues/633)).

58.4. **Verify before documenting:** confirm on-disk paths with `ls -la` and a sample `SKILL.md` under each vendor folder; do not assume folder names from other tools (`config/skills` vs `skills` vs `~/.agents/skills`).

58.5. **Fallback:** if Antigravity still misses skills, add the **absolute** path to `~/.agents/skills` under Settings → Customizations → Skill Custom Paths (tilde may not expand). Restart IDE; open a fresh conversation.

58.6. **Cross-reference:** wiring recipes and verify bash in `agent-runtime-layout.md` (Gemini CLI and Antigravity section) and `docs/AGENTS.md` (Verify wiring).

58.7. **Do not let `npx skills add` rewrite the shared registry through a symlink.** When `~/.agents/skills` (or `~/.cursor/skills` / `~/.claude/skills`) is a symlink into `instructions_repo/agents/skills`, a global `skills add --copy` writes into the git tree. That can drop `LICENSE.txt`, reintroduce vendor `agents/` adapters, or otherwise mutate the playbook outside an intentional vendor pass. Prefer: (1) copy upstream `skills/<name>/` into `agents/skills/<name>/` yourself, drop vendor-specific `agents/` folders, set `metadata.upstream`, copy upstream `LICENSE` to `LICENSE.txt`; (2) install Claude/Codex/Antigravity via their native plugin CLIs; (3) never replace the whole `~/.agents/skills` directory symlink with a real folder. After any CLI install that targets `~/.agents/skills`, `ls` the skill dir and `git status` the playbook before assuming the tree is clean.

## 59. Vision/OCR Reads Need Text-Source Verification Before Correcting an Artifact

When a vision or OCR model interprets a screenshot, photo, or scanned image and its read disagrees with a value already in an artifact (a doc, config, data file, or code), the default hypothesis is that the IMAGE READ is wrong, not the artifact. Image models produce systematic, internally consistent misreads: swapping near-identical words (two verbs that differ by a few characters), dropping prefixes, or normalizing unusual tokens to common ones. A wrong read can therefore look confident and self-consistent and look like an artifact error that needs fixing.

**Rule:** before changing an existing artifact value to match a vision/OCR read, confirm the read against an authoritative text source (the spec, official instructions, the source document's extracted text, or a second independent extraction). Correct the artifact only if the text source agrees with the vision read.

**Anti-pattern:** a field in a doc carries a non-obvious code (a letter prefix plus digits). A screenshot of the same field is fed to a vision model, which returns a plausible value with the prefix dropped and a similar word substituted. Treating the disagreement as a stale doc and "correcting" the doc to the vision value, without checking the authoritative reference, introduces an error into an artifact that was already right.

**Qualification gate (when this rule applies):**
- A vision/OCR result contradicts a value currently in a tracked artifact, and
- you are about to edit the artifact to match the image read, and
- you have not yet checked the image read against a text source (extracted text, spec, official manual, second extraction).

**General form:** image-derived claims are unverified interpretations of unstructured input with known characteristic failure modes (systematic, consistent misreads). They are not primary sources. An existing artifact value that the read contradicts is evidence the read may be wrong; resolve the contradiction against a text source before mutating anything.

**Why this matters:** the failure mode is a silent regression. You "fix" something that was correct, and because the wrong read was confident and consistent, the mistake does not feel like a mistake. The verify step costs seconds; the wrong edit propagates into committed work.

## 60. Active Code Review: Actionable Fixes Need Code Snippets

When `doing-code-review` (or any staged PR review) proposes a concrete code, test, or config change the author can apply immediately, the **Comment** must include a before/after or "could look like" snippet per `doing-code-review` §4.9.0. This applies at **all severities**, including Low test-gap findings; Medium+ depth alone is not enough without a snippet when the fix is actionable.

60.1. **Orchestrator polish pass:** check every staged finding with an actionable fix for a fenced code block in the Comment, not only Medium+ findings. Relaunch the responsible sub-agent or expand during staging when missing.

60.2. **Sub-agent output:** Step 3 prompts and `review-agents/testing.md` require snippets in `body` for actionable fixes at any severity.

60.3. **Test examples in review comments:** build data once (builder/fixture), then assert with getters from that object (`outbox.getCampaignId()`, `outbox.getDedupeKey()`). Do not repeat the same literal in setup and asserts; duplicated literals let both sides drift and hide mapping bugs.

60.4. **Verify claims before "deferred" shorthand:** do not say a plan or doc "defers" work unless a normative section says so. A single stale checked task or javadoc note is not a design decision.

60.5. **Housekeeping the author should see:** suggestions such as archiving a completed plan to `{plans_completed_dir}/` belong in a PR comment (Low), not only in internal staging notes.

**Cross-reference:** `doing-code-review` §4.9.0, §4.12 orchestrator polish; `review-agents/testing.md` Actionable fix snippets.

## 61. Interactive Cloud or Registry Auth: Give the Operator a Script

When verification needs private registry or cloud credentials (for example AWS SSO + ECR `docker login`) and the auth step is **interactive** (browser SSO, device code, MFA):

61.1. **Do not** block the agent session on that interactive login, and do not invent personal SSO session names into committed docs.

61.2. Give the operator a short copy-paste shell script (SSO refresh + `docker login` + optional `docker pull` smoke), then wait for them to confirm.

61.3. After they confirm, **re-run** the pull/Compose/Testcontainers checks before claiming the private-image path works.

61.4. Document durable how-tos in the project's Layer 2 local-dev guide with **generic** CLI forms (`aws sso login`, registry host from the image URL). Omit personal profile/session names and other machine-private identity.

**Why this matters:** Agents cannot complete browser SSO for the user. Claiming "Compose and Testcontainers should work" before auth and without a re-check wastes a round trip; hardcoding personal SSO identifiers into the repo leaks private config.

## 62. Implementation Plan Checklists Contain Executable Tasks Only

Implementation-plan checklists contain executable plan tasks only. Keep deployed, cross-team, and human-owned conditions under **Ship when** as narrative prose. Checklist exceptions and optional Jira tracking require user confirmation; follow the `plans`, `review-plan`, and `execute-plan` skills for the authoring, review, and execution procedures. Completed history remains immutable under `docs/maintenance/project-decisions.md` ADR-0001.
