"""Reject backlog-inbox filename shapes outside the resolved backlog home.

Filename-only gate (content is never inspected), case-insensitive on the
basename:

- rule 1: basename contains ``backlog`` OR ``deferred`` AND the path is under
  one of the named hot dirs (``docs/maintenance/``, ``docs/architecture/``,
  ``docs/tmp/``); scanned over a FILESYSTEM walk so untracked and gitignored
  files are seen. Intentional precedence: rule 1 fires BEFORE the backlog-home
  exclusion, so named hot dirs gate regardless of facts state, including when
  a configured backlog home sits under a hot dir. Symlinked DIRECTORIES
  inside a hot dir whose targets stay inside it are traversed and their
  files reported under the symlink (link) path; escaping or broken
  directory targets (and broken file links) are skipped with a
  ``hot-dir symlink not traversed`` warning on stderr (unreadable subtrees
  warn ``cannot read hot-dir subtree``). A symlinked FILE is reported
  under its link name regardless of the target location (classification is
  filename-shape only; the target is never read).
- rule 2: basename contains BOTH ``backlog`` AND ``deferred`` AND the path is
  outside the backlog home; scanned over tracked files (``git ls-files -z``).

Backlog home resolves from ``.ai-playbook/facts.md`` TOML keys
``backlog_dir`` / ``backlog_completed_dir`` with fallback defaults and a
stderr warning when missing. A value resolving (e.g. through a symlink)
outside the repo root, or to the repo root itself, warns and falls back
to the default. Two ``docs/tmp/`` carve-outs (path-segment
boundaries / basename prefix only) keep this repo's own conventions green.

Rule 1's hot dirs come from the optional ``backlog_hot_dirs`` key: a
quoted string of repo-relative directories separated by whitespace
and/or commas (the TOML fence parser is scalar-only, so an array literal
parses as missing). The configured list REPLACES the built-in defaults
(``docs/maintenance``, ``docs/architecture``, ``docs/tmp``). A missing
key falls back to the defaults silently. A blank key, or an effective
set that ends up empty after validation, warns on stderr and falls
  back to the defaults. Invalid entries (absolute, ``.``, ``..`` itself or
  a path whose first segment escapes with ``..``), entries resolving to a
  nonexistent repo path, and symlinked entries resolving outside the repo
  root warn on stderr and
  are DROPPED while surviving configured entries stay active, so rule 1
  can never silently disable. ``~``-prefixed entries are
expanduser-ed first; an expanded absolute result is dropped by the
invalid-entry rule.

Exit 0 when clean, 1 when any violation (each printed as ``<path>: rule <N>``).
The default scan root anchors at the git toplevel of the current directory
and warns on stderr before falling back to the CWD when git is unavailable.

    form is the regression witness); (2) carve-out evasion — the

    outside the repo, and inside the repo but outside the hot dir) are
    flagged ``hot-dir symlink not traversed`` and NOT scanned; (4) cycle —
    a mutual symlink loop terminates via the visited set with no flag
    (guarded by a 60s timeout); (5) file-link parity — a symlinked FILE
    yields under its link basename; (6) broken — a dangling symlink is
    flagged and produces no violation; (7) default-dir-escape — a
    symlinked DEFAULT hot dir (no ``backlog_hot_dirs`` key) resolving
    outside the repo root trips the ``scan_repo`` top-level containment
    check, which is otherwise unreachable for configured entries (the
