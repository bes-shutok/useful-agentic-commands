"""Private review corpus discovery, conservation, and baseline lifecycle.

Phase 2 review-effectiveness telemetry. Task 1 scope (this file): build the
private corpus discovery and conservation layer:

- Allowlisted facts-driven discovery (imports ``facts_paths``; never re-parses).
- SHA-256 inventory of every discovered sidecar into a private baseline.
- Private baseline lifecycle: atomic ``--init-baseline``, ``--strict-audit``
  (read-only over sidecar content; normalizes private-file modes to
  0600/0700, stderr warning if a tighten is refused), explicit
  ``--refresh-baseline``, with a transition table.
- Single-authority cutover classification: snapshot members are ``baseline``; a
  discovered sidecar is ``growth`` iff it is not in the snapshot AND its panel
  identities satisfy the five-worker set.
- Audit-anomaly flagging: timestamp/panel/schema mismatch with the cutover
  marker is an audit signal, never a re-classification.
- Strict conservation audit: every discovered sidecar in exactly one ledger
  class. Per-sidecar current/legacy classification and finding conservation are
  delegated to ``validate_review_staging.py`` public functions.

Privacy invariant: path-level baseline and conservation data live ONLY under
``~/.ai-playbook/review-telemetry/`` (local, untracked). No path-level data
enters any tracked file. Aggregate public output is built in later tasks.

Concurrency invariant: a process-wide ``fcntl.flock`` on the telemetry lock is
held across discover->digest->parse->aggregate->publish; each input is read
once into an immutable byte buffer used for both digest and parse; before
publish the on-disk generation is rechecked with a bounded (3) retry, then
publication fails rather than emit a mixed-version snapshot.

Permissions invariant (TOCTOU-safe): the telemetry dir is created with
``os.mkdir(..., 0o700)`` under a cleared umask; private files are created with
``os.open(O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_WRONLY, 0o600)`` then ``fdopen`` (never
create-then-chmod); symlink targets are rejected; the parent ``~/.ai-playbook/``
is tightened to ``0700`` or the script refuses to run, re-asserted every run.

Stdlib only. No em-dashes (repository convention).

    On the success path every published digest matches the byte buffer used for
    parsing. If an input changed between the buffer read and the recheck, retry
    up to ``retries`` times (re-reading the buffer); after that fail publication
    rather than publish a mixed-version snapshot. The caller's ``publish_fn``
    is invoked once per attempt after the recheck passes.

    Load-bearing contract: on retry the ``buffers`` dict is refreshed IN PLACE
    (existing keys re-read from disk) before ``publish_fn`` is invoked. A
    ``publish_fn`` that writes bytes serialized before the recheck, ignoring
    the refreshed ``buffers``, publishes a stale snapshot that still passes
    this gate. Every caller MUST derive its published payload content from
    the current ``buffers`` contents at invocation time (see the cohort
    paragraph below for the one exception).

    Cohort membership is the caller's concern and may be pinned to a
    pre-publish ledger or snapshot (as ``cmd_strict_audit`` does): only
    payload content must follow the refreshed buffers. Consequently a
    caller that ignores the returned attempt count keeps its ledger-derived
    summary and exit code pinned to the pre-publish ledger, which may lag
    a retry-absorbed mutation, while the published report is rebuilt from
    the refreshed buffers; callers that consume the attempt count (as
    ``cmd_strict_audit`` does for its summary and exit code) recompute
    ledger-derived state over the refreshed buffers. Cohort membership
    itself stays ledger-pinned. New callers must pin the freshness
    contract with a
    selftest fixture modeled on the ``strict_audit_stale_snapshot`` family;
    this gate cannot observe what ``publish_fn`` serialized.

    ``attempt_observer`` is informational only: invoked after each in-place
    buffer refresh with a snapshot (shallow copy) of the refreshed buffers,
    it lets a caller track per-attempt parse state that the single final
    ``publish_fn`` invocation cannot observe (as ``cmd_strict_audit`` does
    for window-aware chronicity). Residual: transient parse states that
    keep the byte size equal and are visible only to a recheck digest read
    (repair and re-break of equal-size content between two refreshes) are
    unobservable at the refresh site; this accepted residual is analogous
    to ``_pinned_parent``'s documented intermediate-ancestor residual.

    Returns the attempt count: ``1`` when the first recheck passed (no
    retry), ``N+1`` after ``N`` absorbed retries. Callers use this signal
    to detect a retry-absorbed mutation and recompute ledger-derived state
    over the refreshed buffers (as ``cmd_strict_audit`` does for its
    ``replaced`` set); the ``classes=`` ledger summary stays ledger-pinned.
