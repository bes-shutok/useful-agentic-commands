"""Fail-closed readiness validator for reviewed plans.

Given a plan path, answers: does the latest review of these exact plan bytes
report ready=yes with zero unresolved blocking findings and a valid sidecar?

Exit 0 only when every readiness condition passes; otherwise prints the FIRST
failed condition and exits 1. Digest, schema, sidecar-path, and review-parsing
rules are IMPORTED from ``validate_review_staging.py`` (same directory); the
digest recipe is never re-implemented here. ``{plans_dir}`` and ``{reviews_dir}``
resolve from the ``.ai-playbook/facts.md`` TOML block via ``facts_paths.py``.

Condition ordering inside ``evaluate_readiness`` is deliberate: local
readability checks (plan path, review artifact, sidecar file, sidecar JSON,
review UTF-8, plan bytes) run first so each gets its own named reason, then
the shared sidecar gate (schema, source_kind, digest), then the verdict line,
then ``is_review_ready``. Several of those readability steps re-state checks
the shared gate would also make; they exist for reason classification, not
duplication.
