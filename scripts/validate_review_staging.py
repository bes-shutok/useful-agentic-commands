    """Fence-aware line classifier shared by every Markdown scanner here.

    The single owner of the fence state machine (r1 F3): a fence opens on a
    line matching ``FENCE_LINE_RE`` — openers keep prefix-match semantics
    (either delimiter character, run of 3+, info strings allowed). A fence
    closes ONLY on a bare, equal-or-longer run of the same delimiter
    character as the opener (leading/trailing whitespace on the close line
    is allowed; any other suffix — info string or mixed characters — keeps
    the line fenced content, and a run of the other delimiter character
    never closes however long it is). This same-char + equal-or-longer +
    bare close rule supersedes the consolidation plan's length-only pin
    (r5 F5's "the delimiter character is not compared" is retired). Emits
    one event per input line, drawn from the specified vocabulary:

    - ``("fence_opener", None)``: this line opens a fence;
    - ``("fence_close", None)``: this line closes the currently open fence;
    - ``("in_fence_content", None)``: this line is content inside an open
      fence (never a heading, boundary, or metadata candidate);
    - ``("heading", raw_text)``: a heading line the consumer maps to its own
      semantics (severity-group ``### <Severity>`` vs finding header
      ``#### F<N>.`` vs other ``####``); the classifier does NOT classify
      heading sub-kinds (r2 F4);
    - ``("ordinary", raw_text)``: any other line outside a fence.

    Reset policy: with no ``is_reset_heading`` predicate (the default,
    content-preserving), a heading inside an open fence is
    ``in_fence_content`` (r5 F8 fenced-example purity). Passing a
    callable selects heading-reset mode (the r4 F3 containment mode for
    fences that never close, keyword-only so a half-configured mode is
    structurally unrepresentable rather than conventionally): a heading
    inside an open fence resets the fence state iff
    ``is_reset_heading(raw_text)`` is truthy (each consumer pins its own
    reset heading set); otherwise it stays fenced content.

    Returns ``(events, unclosed_opener_index)`` where
    ``unclosed_opener_index`` is the line index of the fence opener that never
    closed, or None when every fence closed (consumers use it to apply the
    partial fallback: keep pre-opener first-pass results, re-classify only
    from the opener onward).

    ``None``, and the first element is the FULL first-pass event list. When a

    ``is_reset_heading`` is a required positional argument, unlike the
